Dude your playlist title says &quot;Python for beginners&quot;...but with your super pace of explanations, no beginners will understand the concepts. Your way of tutoring is way too hard to understand for the beginners. I would not suggest to <br>follow these videos to any of the beginners to learn Python.
Tgis guy reminds me of the  butler from the film . WHY HIM😂❤

Hi Navin. Thank you so much for your videos on python..I&#39;ve watched and completed your entire python playlist. Using your video am confident enough to tell that &quot;i&#39;ve excelled in python&quot; that too without any coding background. Now am in need of learning C#. Can you kindly share a playlist on C# If possible? Once again thanks a lot for creating such a useful playlist that is very easy to understand even without any basic or prerequisite knowledge.

How to install Python program in android mobile
As someone who’s bad at programming, I’m very relieved to learn that Python is the (or at least one of the) easiest languages to learn. I’m comfortable with Java because it was the first programming language I’ve learned but when trying to learn other languages like C# and C++ I found them very difficult.

Hey,<br>In my lap when i typed nums.  There is no pop up so i tried cntrl + space its also not working .can you explain me why this is happening?
Hi sir, first of all your session is fantastic and its quite easy to understand and learn...Thank you so much<br>Sir I have a question...while discussing the list u said that nums[-1] will give the last number which is actually the first number from the right end...But usually the index starts from 0 so why can&#39;t we use -0 instead of -1 to get the last number....well I have tried that and got my output as the first number itself y so??  can you give me a simple explanation
can you please do the same for c programming also
you&#39;re better in teaching than coding with harry
Yay
answer is &#39;s&#39;
Hlo Sir,<br>I am not getting a pop up after nums.<br>Can you clarify how to get..
I don&#39;t have any option of append and etc
So just to be clear, for remove we use the list value for pop we use the value index

Hi sir at 4.57 can we try to add nums + names will the output be same as for mil = [nums,names ] or it differs sir
I started learning Python on Coursera through the Google Certificate set, and I felt it was not progressing or teaching in my style of learning. I felt it was lacking the BASE basics of coding in this language. You do so well breaking it down in to bite sized chunks which is a huge help, thank you!!!!
If I pass my IT coding exam tomorrow, it will be thanks to this course. I will let you know how it goes hhaha I am literally only learning this because I understand it (much more than our uni books) <br>Thankss for the content
Is it sufficient for python learners who is looking for Dsa
Sir I am actually struggling for......the type of names like num , pop, math ..... from the past 5 videos I  cant able to get them.<br><br>My request is that add a small video on that tutorial, I mean wt is math , num, etc
Hii sir I am a 14years child I been wanting to learn python so that I can create a game ,and I am quite interested in coding ,because of ur teaching I learned python, made my dreams complete,and thank u so much ,ur teaching is helping me a lot sir

Hey I just go confused like when you did insert in nums (2,77)  and you told that 77 came in the place of 2 but instead it came at 3 position in the bracket
The videos and the way of explanation is great. But as it been 5 years, is the content still relevant?
what key do you use to enter the parentheses automatically? i mean this [ ] I do type it from keyboard but I am sure you have the shortcut
Finally i got a best teacher ❤

I’m a Houdini learner try to learn from u python
Haiiii,i dropper of jee 2024 this year .so i am going to learn python now with my amazing sir &quot; navin sir&quot;💙💙.....<br>My mother at the age of 46, and learning python with me as well.its a big deal for her , because she is uneducated, sixth passed out only .and we live in villages.she even don&#39;t know how to use mobile also......but she learning python......love u mommmm❤️❤️❤️❤️
nums.pop() actually deletes the number with the last index number, not the last one added. Like in the example, 77 is the last in, but if you use pop, it deletes 45, not 77.
When you are showing the use of nums.pop() , it gave us 45, but it should be 77  which is the last element added, or you are referring to the last element in the list. Can you explain?

funny thing is my numbers for the last doubled 98 set didn&#39;t come the same as yours as well, that was something interesting I learned from watching this video as well as learning the coding setup of course. Doing an awesome job!!
most important yt channel
The answer is:<br>del nums[2:5]<br>nums<br>[25,36,26]
I&#39;m unable to work with help
For the quiz at the end of the video I used list... del nums[2:5] ....Thank you! Really good tutoring.
Yes sir we enjoyed a lot😊
Thank navin
so we have to first make a list of nums given, then use nums.remove(95) enter, same for other two and then when we check nums we would see these numbers removed from the list. is there a shortcut to remove all the three at one shot?
my answer to the quiz: <br>nums = [25,36,95,14,12,26]<br>print nums<br>[25, 36, 95, 14, 12, 26]<br>del nums[2:5]<br>print nums<br>[25, 36, 26]   <br>Thank you I&#39;m leaning so much !
Thanks for the tutorials navin. My question is ..apart from the set function displaying values  in  a different sequence what else does it do.. coz i tried using set.pop{} in vain.  it brought error.<br>i even used the curly brackets.
Sir  i have try with my creative value of using s= [random number]. When i like to arrange them in ascending order i used s.sort()<br>s<br>An i have got it right, that&#39;s the correction that i have made, and you don&#39;t show us in the video
but I can change the tuple values in here, how ????<br>Yeah I put a space as &quot;tup  [1]  =  33&quot;
nums=[25,36,95,14,12,26]<br>del nums[2:5]<br>print(nums)
I&#39;m really enjoying your classes, more grease to your elbow
del numb [2:4]
i think in the new update they made it so tup could be changed<br>cause it did for mine
Where is the quiz? 😮
del nums[2:5]<br>there you will get the answere

Remove keyword is use to list item from list
I hate programming .but your tutorial changed my idea.
nums.remove (95)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.remove (14)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.remove (12)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; nums<br>[25, 36, 26]
answer to the question<br>del nums[2:4]
by using <br><br><br>del nums[2:5]
When I typed s = {22,25,14,21,5} and enter than s and enter, I got this sequence {5, 21, 22, 25, 14} (in IDLE Shell 3.11.4) instead of {5, 14, 21, 22, 25} like you got. Also, when I typed s = {25,14,98,63,75,98} and enter than s and enter, I got this sequence {98, 25, 75, 14, 63}, instead of {98, 75, 14, 25, 63}. How come?
s={23,23,23,23,434,3451,5343,}<br>set values  work and it removes duplicates as well<br><br>{434, 3451, 23, 5343}

Bro, I would recommend this more than the in-person teachers you need to pay $500 per month.
del nums[2:5]
If sets don&#39;t have index numbers then what are we supposed to enter inside pop, I experimented a bit and s.pop() jut removed the first value from the set, is that all it does?

Del nums[2:5]
Well thanks a lot sir you are great I am watching this video 4 years after the upload but I loved your explanation a lot.<br>and here the answer :-<br><br>nums = [25, 36, 95, 14, 12, 26]<br>nums<br>[25, 36, 95, 14, 12, 26]<br>del nums[2:5]<br>nums<br>[25, 36, 26]
Thank You Navin... <br>Any one know- how to search YouTube comments using mobile! <br>There are 1.4k comments as on today.
I will give you a 10subcribers
# 3rd way and the one I enjoyed the most <br><br>nums = [25,36,95,14,12,26]<br>nums.pop(2)<br>nums.pop(2) # here also only one number can be popped out at a time<br>nums.pop(2) # point to be noted is after popping out 2nd index number i.e. &quot;95&quot; , now&quot;14&quot; comes at a place of 2nd index number<br>print(nums)
# 2nd way to solve<br>nums=[25,36,95,14,12,26]<br>nums.remove(95) <br>nums.remove(14) # here we have to use remove function separately for each number as it takes only one argument at a time<br>nums.remove(12)<br>print(nums)
nums=[25,36,95,14,12,26]<br>del nums[2:4]   <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23del"">#del</a> function will delete numbers from index 2 to index 4  as required in the quiz<br>print(nums)

I have finally discovered the best channel for learning Python. Your teaching style is truly awesome.
I am new to this, without having any prior experience of programing or degree related to computer. I am understanding all this but 1 thing which is coming to my mind is how I am going to remember all these things, all these brackets and terms. Is there any way to overcome this issue?

Mutability refers to the ability to modify the object after creation. for eg LIST is a mutable object as we can do various operations like addition, deletion, removal; unlike tuples and strings.
Can anyone please tell what is set path used for?
Mutability means in which we can change values....
Mutability is the ability to change.<br>We can make changes in LIST, but not in tuple and strings bcz of their immutable nature.<br>Also, we have index option only in List and tuple but not in strings.
mutability is means tendency to change , which means we can change the value/edit the value like i edited this comment

Mulability: mutable means changeability in any thing.<br>like: lists are mutable i.e we change list doing certain operations append, delete, sort, etc<br>and tuple: are immutable we not modify tuple like we do operations in lists<br>dictionary: It is storing values in form of keys and values <br>set: sets not have duplicates but sets are mutable.
Mutability means we can change or edit the data.
After When I copy and paste the path again opening cmd when I hit enter it is opening Microsoft Store in my computer

mutability means the ability to change their values...and thanks for a great lecture.
Thank you sir
Thanks for the help. Your video was very descriptive !
I have no idea which one he copied to put path
MUTABLITY :-its means changing the value is know as the muatbility
Mutability is a feature exclusive to sets and lists. It is the ability of the lists and sets to update and add new values to the existing collection of data.
mutability means after creating a variable in python , we can change its value  by using its  functions the list datatype in python is mutable and tuple and sets are immutable we cannot change its value
hello, great helps, fast, perfect topic who was good to show, thanks a lot :)
Nobody will tell us these small details like U are doing. Not our college/school teachers, maybe not even our private tutors or most of the Youtubers either. I cannot express how much I appreciate your work &amp; only wish had I found this channel earlier, would&#39;ve spared me a lot of troubles. But fortunately it&#39;s never too late &amp; now I&#39;m here &amp; enjoying this amazing work of your. Thanks a lot, Sir😊
Thank you for putting so much hard work in it.

THANK YOU
Nice
Too fast, and when copying the path have no idea whish folder/file he is talking about.

Thank you
Hi Navin, when i use help option it says no python documentation found in the command promt
Mutability means changeable. For example lists are mutable that we can append or remove an item whereas in tuple it is immutable.
thanx sir
If something is mutable, for example say a list is mutable, that means its original values that the list contains can be changed.
I install very latest version of python. but when I set the path, I can&#39;t see the script.<br>please guide me what to do?
Can you please tell me how you added multiple paths???Because when I tried to add new previous one get replaced .<br>Edit: I got it now😊

List is mutable...set is is immutable<br>Enclosed with square brackets.... enclosed with paranthesis ..both are collection of data
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OZIAHg5i7M&amp;t=8m01s"">8:01</a> back then yes, but is it possible to make a variable constant now?
Sir can I get certificate for completion
Fantastic👌, absolutely got crystal clear clarity regarding address of a value assigned to variable, a little bit clarity about garbage collection👍. These are most fundamental concepts and you have made it so easy to understand, love the way you teach❤                  Difference between set and list --&gt; List is ordered sequence data type containing similar or different type of collection of data within [ ], Set is a sequence data type but not ordered containing unique collection of datas (not reapted) within { }.
List is mutable and  the elements of list are denoted  in [ ] whereas set is immutable and the elements of set are denoted in { }
One more difference in set and list  is we can&#39;t do indexing in sets but in lists we can
Yeaahhhh! Tks bro! Tks so much !
Hey Navin !<br>I have a doubt.<br>What is the need of &quot;address of a variable&quot; in Python ?
List is a mutable. Lists are ordered, changeable and allows duplicate values<br>Set are unordered, duplicate values are not allowed
We can sort list.But we can&#39;t sort set
i was not getting the same address for same values
Thank you Navin. I&#39;m again revisiting this series after 3 years to brush up my basics, still this is afresh and I learn new things.
a list is a collection of values which is defined with square bracket whereas a set is a collection of key value pair which is defined with curly brackets
in list we can change and replace the item but in set we can&#39;t
Hi Navin, You are doing outstanding Job, Kudos Man.<br>can you please recommmend a Book to refer for a absolute beginner to Learn.<br>Thanks in Advance.
Q:Difference between the set and list?<br>Ans: Set is a collection of objects it is mutable object, it is having unordered data, it will not allow duplicates, It will not follow indexing, set will be represent like {}.<br>List is a collection of objects, list is mutable, what ever values we  are given in a list same order it will follow, based on indexing we can  fetch the values, list will be represented like this[].
list is a  collection of data and mutable (we can change the data and modified the data) and ordered and it can allow the duplicate values. where as set is mutable(in python) unordered , and    it never allows the duplicate values
I am getting different values
I think the computer i.e. the IDE must have stored the variable with the input value in his memory
super, I understood this concept
Even when the value of &quot;a&quot; changed, how &quot;b&quot; is still 10?
You are intelligent thank you you&#39;re only teacher that can teach python
Maaa nv telugu na mawa❤❤❤
Set and List both are mutable in nature. The major differences are sets are represented by flower bracket or curly bracket while list in square bracket. Set is a collection of unique elements while list can have any elements including repeated values. Set won&#39;t have index value as it can&#39;t maintain sequence while lists can!
Sets:-<br>It is also a type of list but not so effective as list. it&#39;s immutable<br>List:-<br>More effective and can change the things of it..
In listing values be in sequence,<br>And,in set the values are not been in sequence<br>Listing has lot of features
list is mutable where as set is immutable
Thankyou....sir🤩🤩🤩🤩god bless you🙌🙌😇😇😇😇🥰🥰🥰🥰<br>Answer of the quiz :<br>Set is unordered and contain different elements,whereas the list is ordered and contain the same elements in it.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OZIAHg5i7M&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a>
this is the best
I found that in jupyter id for 1 is140733599490448<br><br>and in id for 2 is 140733599490448+32 and so on +32 +32
The difference between a set and list is that in a set we don&#39;t have any order and can&#39;t call values by indeces. In a set all values are unique. But in a list we have an order and can adress to any of its values by index
Can we rename the address to a number or name of our choice?
I tried to run this command for getting the address of variable and it is changing the address everytime i run the command print(id(a)) in pycharm for macos, can you please help to understand why is it doing different from what you are explaining ?
List is an ordered collection of elements in the data structure of Python which allows duplication and is defined by square brackets [ ]; SET is non ordered collection of elements which does not allow duplication of elements and is defined by curly brackets {}. since no duplication is allowed in sets it offers an advantage to look out for specific objects with more efficiency.
If we want immutable data we have set, here we don&#39;t have index value of any data and it doesn&#39;t allow duplication.<br>If we need mutable data, with all the type of variation we have list, here we can define integer, string with each data having index number.
list is ordered but set is unordered , in list we can have reptation of values but in sets all values should be unique
very informative! You don&#39;t miss even the tiny thing that might be a flaw in the basics. Thanks for your videos.
I took a=5, b=id(a). However, when I checked id(b) and id(id(a)), I got different values. Please explain the reason.
i love the way he gets every little detail and explains it perfectly without any confussion i ussually dont like teachers but this one i love
Thank God.. I found this you tube channel ❤️💯
I&#39;m in last sem of my engineering degree and still doing this beginners&#39; course...but I&#39;m definitely nd confidential about saying that...I have learnt Python this well from anywhere else till date. Thank you for such a fantastic representation on Python🥺🌟💯
a=10 later a=9 if we want to use a=10 still how can we use it
Sets will not maintain sequence but list maintain
Answer for the homework question is<br>The difference between the set and list is that in 1) set indexing is not possible but whereas it is possible  in list<br>2)in set the values move in random<br><br>If  it is correct hit me a like
&quot;Variables of the same value are given the same memory address&quot; can sometimes work against you. Learned it the hard way from a code like this:<br><br>a=[1,2,3]<br>b=a<br>for i in range(1,4):<br>    for num in a:<br>        b.append(num+i*10)<br><br>The intent was to make a list of this pattern: [1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, ...]. But since python uses the same memory address for a and b, appending list &quot;b&quot; will also change list &quot;a&quot;. With the for loop trying go through a list that keeps expanding each iteration, the loop becomes infinite. To avoid this issue, make &quot;a&quot; a tuple (a=tuple(a)) after the line &quot;b=a&#39;. This will result in &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; having different addresses and less likely to be mixed up.

brilliant explanation in every video 👍
List - [ ] <br>Set -{ }
sir in python command prompt when i will type LISTS it is shor=wing that No documentation was found what is that mean sir
Kindly provide pdf for python tutorial .
List is define by []<br>and Set is define by{}<br><br>The difference between the two is, in Set after we input the elements into its variable and print it,  the sequence of the result will be scrambled, List doesn&#39;t
You&#39;re talking like we will talk about this later but you should have given basic idea otherwise who knows it will be talked later or not.
@telusuko...aww your teaching is jst awesome
1. Set is collection of objects which is shows in curly brackets{} wher list shows in square brackets[]<br>2. Set is collection of objects where repeation of objects is not allowed but in list repeation of objects is allowed.<br>3. In set indexing and slicing operation not applied bcz in set sequence is not defined but list performs indexing and slicing.
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OZIAHg5i7M&amp;t=2m05s"">2:05</a>, I think it is better if you give a = 10 and b = 10 as the example and show both the ids are the same. Instead of using b = a, as the initial step. Again, we cannot see the question properly, could you add the question in the description?
List is collection of data and there index is unique, we can fetch data by using index. While set is collection of unique data without any index.
Sir your explanation is really good<br>But please give me the notes
Set mantain sequence and speed<br>List doesn t maintain sequence and speed
Sir,we are using same varible to different no. Then address also changes.. <br>Will computer won&#39;t confuse...?
Hi Navin,<br>I really enjoyed python programming videos. learned alot. thnx  <br>i observed one issue in memory addressing for variable case <br><br>Issue is:  memory address assignment based on value of a variable, it worked for lower values like 100 but id&#39;t worked same for 1000 value  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;id(100)<br>140723475810464<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;a=100<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;b=100<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;id(a)<br>140723475810464<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;id(b)<br>140723475810464<br><br>till now its fine but when checked same thing for 1000<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; id(1000)<br>2356012700560<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=1000<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; id(a)<br>2356012700560<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; b=1000<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; id(b)<br>2356012700592<br><br>i checked in python-3.7.9 and 3.5.2 both versions observed same issue.<br>is thing i am  missing logically here ?
very goooooood
SET:-in set we use flower brackets[{}],and also the set do not use sequence<br>LISTS:-IN list we use square brackets([ ]),and also if follow the sequence ,its mutable
i cant see the quizes because of the ads at the end of the video? any help plz
l1 = [1,2]<br>l2 = [1,2]<br>why are id(l1) and id(l2) are different?
list: Follow zero based indexing, Contain hetrogeneous elements, To define we use square bracket<br>set: Doesn&#39;t follow zero based indexing because there is no sequence in set, Contain unique elements, To define we use curlie bracket
Excellent video. I could not understand this concept from a linkedin course. Hats off
List have a sequential order <br>Set don&#39;t have any sequential order<br><br>List can print repeated values<br>Set don&#39;t print repeated values
Nice
thank you sir for teaching us
Set <br>1-not support indexing<br>2-not support duplicated<br>3-cant&#39;s change or replace value.<br><br>List<br>1-we can asses value by index<br>2-we can add, remove or change any value
HE IS THE BEST
The main difference between set and list is that set is unordered, unindexed, immutable and list is indexed and ordered way and it is mutable.
unable to see quiz question it got overlapped by Telusko icon
I was not able to see the question in the end because of Subscription button over question.

In set there is no use index number as their position is not constant.<br>But where in case of list the data is organised and fixed in position that we specified previously.<br>I&#39;m newbie and that&#39;s all i know😁✌️<br>And please let me know if theres anything i should know (as i was a newbie in programming I&#39;m curious to know lot about programming).
To prove this sentence you are here I think so, &quot; best teachers teach from the heart, not from the book &quot; such a nice job, and thank you soo much
the quiz questions are getting blocked by you tube recommendations  . . . . .  anyone out there having any solution for this???

Make you timetable  for everyday and make shower that you follow you timetable <br>4. Social media are just loosing you time stop it.<br>5.Practice <br>6.

Enjoying and Offcourse Learning much from the series.......very helpfull
Sir your explanation is awesome  I have one dout this is full python course Its mean core and advanced in python this is saficent to get a job in python developer
Thank you so so much for tutorial
Another greet lesson!
None=not assigned with any value<br>Tuple=the value which is immutable<br>Set=the values without repetation<br>List=the values which are mutable
None: &#39;None&#39; is a datatype(variable) with nothing stored in it                                                          Numeric: Its when we deal with numbers....It has 4 types: 1) Integer(for integers) 2) Float(for point representation) 3) Complex(for complex numbers) 4) Boolean(It tells us whether true or false)                                                                                                                              Sequence: It has also various types.....1)List(&#39;[]&#39; used and mutable) 2) Tuple(&#39;()&#39; used and immutable) 3) Set(&#39;{}&#39; used and immutable and does not support indexing) 4) String: &#39;str&#39; used whenever we need to type letters and not numbers.

numeric , boolean ,set, dictionary answer for the quiz
THANK YOU FOR THAT SESSION, IT WAS A GOOD ONE
None = Which is used to assign None to a variable means no value in other language we use Null!!<br>Numeric= It includes int float bool complex, Basically it has all inbuilt data types<br>List = This is my favourite datatype which is similar to array but the difference is that you can store different type of value in List and it is created by following syntax:<br>lisy = [&#39;Hey&#39;,&#39;Telusko&#39;]<br>or you can make anyother sequence like string , tupple in list using list() inbuilt funciton.<br>Tupple = It is similar to list but here we cant change the value after assignment because it is immutable so if you want to change a tupple first convert it into a list and then change your requirements and then again change that list to tupple.<br>For example:<br>tup = (1,2,3,4,5)<br>list = list(tup)<br>list.append(6)<br>list.insert(3,8)<br>tup = tupple(list)<br>Thanks telusko for helping us love from india!!!!
what about modulo : &quot;%&quot;
you are really amazing the way you teaches is great
TQ bro
Why do we not use @ operator for matrix multiplication that much, any comments?
The Answer for The Quiz : <br>1. String, it&#39;s Data Type Consist of Letters or Sentence.<br>2. Integer,  A Data Types that consist of number.<br>3.  Float, A Data Types consist of Decimal number<br>4. Tuple, A Group of immutable Values
I tried and found that &quot;= and&quot; works fine but if you reverse the order &quot;and =&quot; it will give you<br>SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Answer to the question:<br>None - when a variable doesn&#39;t have a value<br>Numeric - int, float, complex and bool (related to numbers)<br>Lists - a collection of mutable items<br><br>String - a sequence of characters
What about &quot;in&quot;, &quot;not in&quot;, &quot;is&quot;,  &quot;is not&quot;, are they also operators in Python?
I realized that changes occurs only with - not with + just like in mathematics. <br>n = 7, n = -n , print(n)  -7 (has changed)<br>n = -7, n= +n, print(n)  -7 (hasn&#39;t changed)<br>So the unary operator is &quot; - &quot; Have I got it right?
how does he clear the entire codes on the screen? I mean what command does he use?
Thank you so much sir
Where r u from sir
Please provide the notes for all series
does unary operator means only the &#39;-&#39; sign?
Super and speed
Navin sir, you are good instructor.
Navin u did a great job..Fabolous ,I&#39;m the biginner of learning the python your vedios helped me lot
Well.,.,
List, which is a mutable datatype,<br>Tuple, which is a immutable datatype,<br>set, which is a unordered, unindexed datatype,<br>Dict, which is also knowing as mapping used in the combination of keys and values.
Does &quot;^&quot;  carry any meaning in python?
You are always excellent.. Small request, most of them were migrating from Java if you relates/mention as &quot;same as Java pattern&quot; where ever applicable. It would be more useful. Thanks
thanks, helped alot
And bitwise operator n also membership operator??

I love programming languages such as HTML , python c++ etc
My sir explain same thing and type of you  <br>I think my sir see your video🤔
thank a lot sir🙏
Is float division also a arithmetic operator
Big thank you for helping and supporting
God 🙏🙏🙏
What is unary
thank you for making these videos.
The way u teach is just amazing sir💫thanks alot 🙏
List = A list is use to store the data and it is mutable and it is slower than array.<br>Dict = Dict is the key value pair having a single key but have n no of values it is also mutable.<br>Tuple = Tuple is genrally immutable and it is faster than list.<br>Set = Non repeting values
thanks
Sir your explanation is very good <br>But plese you can speak in hindi.
If someone has explained this in my Engineering in this way. Believe me, I would have been somewhere.
&gt;&gt;4 and 5 <br>4<br>&gt;&gt; 5 and 4 <br>5 <br><br>Can anyone please explain this? please
Thank you very much sir, one of the easiest way that you have explained.
I did not got any quiz questions. Where is it?
thank u sir!
Sir how to write factorial in it. I mean factorial symbol is also same as &quot; ! &quot; <br><br>5! =5x4x3x2x1=120 how can I write it
1.None=refered to null in python<br>2.numerics=int,float,complex, Boolean<br>3.List=collection of values ,they can be mutable and accessed through index <br>4.Tuple =collection of vlaues,they can&#39;t be mutable and accessed through index<br>5.Set=collection of elements where repeated values are not allowed and sequence is also not fallowed and does not support indexing<br>6.String=a string is defined as a collection of characters inside single or double qotes<br>7.Dictionary /mapping=it is same as a set but keys are used for indexing
Hey Naveen you are doing a great job, we always thankful to you because you starts from introduction
Finally i  find you i love your speaking and have a question that you are indian ?
A very good teacher you are ! I love the way you explain all the concepts!!

sir , where we get notes of this python programming?
sir would u provide us notes of urs python programming <br>?
you can also say a = b | a == b to get True
can we use &#39;&amp;&amp;&#39; operator in place of &#39;and&#39;?

x = (a // 4 + b ** 3) &lt;2000 and (b % 4! = 0)<br>solution<br>x = (3 + 1728) &lt;2000 and (3! + 0)<br>x = 1731 &lt;2000 and 0! = 0<br>x = false  <br>x = int(False) <br>x = 0
Thank
x = (a // 4 + b ** 3) &lt;2000 and (b % 4! = 0)<br>solution<br>x = (3 + 1728) &lt;2000 and (3! + 0)<br>x = 1731 &lt;2000 and 0! = 0<br>x = false
the output is false because a//4+b**3 = 1731 &gt; 2000 but b%4 = 0 == 0
False is the answer of the question
All I agree, but why hi Aliens? 😂
if you want to convert from one system to another. you can use function for ex: hex(int(&#39;1010&#39;,2))  in the output: oxa
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWAjbtWBzGs&amp;t=7m15s"">7:15</a> or you can write power versions of number 2 above each and every digit like I do, for example you have 1101 and you can write, 1, 2, 4, 8 above those digits
That&#39;s a wonderful session regarding number system conversion to one from another 👌<br>a = 15<br>b = 12<br>x = (a // 4 + b ** 3) &lt; 2000 and (b % 4 != 0)<br>here b ** 3 = 1728 and a // 4 = 3. So, (a // 4 + b ** 3) = 1731 which is &lt; 2000 --&gt; True<br>b % 4 = 0 remainder so, b % 4 != 0 is False.<br>so output of x is False<br><br>decimal to binary conversion --&gt;<br>31 - 0b11111, 52 - 0b110100, 65 - 0b1000001<br>binary to decimal conversion --&gt;<br>0b110011010 - 410
It gives the output as False because it satisfies the first condition (1731&lt;2000) and for the second condition it fails (12%4! =0).<br>For the &#39;and&#39; operator both conditions should be true. Therefore, the answer is False. @Telusko
The answer is false
Please anna repu 3 ki ibm exam vundhi coding help cheyyandi anna
Hw answer is false because 1731&lt;2000(true) but 12%3 is not 0(false) hence it is false and no op <b>due to no print function</b>
The ans for that question that u have given is &quot;False&quot;becoz it is (and) operator before the and operator it is True value and after (and) the value is  &quot;False&quot; sir
The answer is False because the final answer would contain True and False, according to the truth table of and. Both have to be True for the result to be True. some common terms to note when solving are as follows: //-removes float, **-means raised to the power of a number, % remainder of a division, !-not. With these you should understand how to solve the question.
Really fun in learning, engineering didn&#39;t teach how to use this
Bro this de
output will be False as right condition of &#39;and&#39; operator is false
Ok i did my code for today (18)
sir its using ip conversion formula to convert in binary form  00000000  . means 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 0 it is easy to understand
Hometask done...bin(31)=0b11111, bin(52)=0b110100, bin(65)0b1000001,  the output of x is false as 1731&lt;2000 is True but 0!=0 is False, so as per Truth Table &#39;and &#39; operation refers if one case case is true and other is false then ultimate output is False...Thanks again Mr. Reddy for teaching these concepts so well..
Output:False
ans to quiz is false because the second condition is not satisfying
true
45
False
done
Thank you very much
it is true
110011010...ans 256..<br>M i ri8
false<br>a//4 + b**3 = True<br>but<br>b%4 =0 hence 0!=0 is False
Sir can u tell the output at last question
False. Cause the result of the first parenthesis is 1731. And that is not less than 2000. The second parenthesis gives True though
Its possible to convert floating value to binary?? for example 23.5 to binary???
you really didn&#39;t focus on the octal or the hexadecimal in this specific lesson as much as you focused on the binary to decimal (not saying that is bad tho as I did learn something regarding conversions)...
Can anyone suggest me any videos to understand this topic deeply because I&#39;m from non computer background  it&#39;s difficult to understand for me
x=1731 is &lt;2000 and thus True<br>b%4 =0 and thus b%4 !=0 is False<br>since &amp; operator is used both conditions have to be true for the final statement to be true. but 2nd part is False. so the output will be False
for 110011010 it said 410 why is that?
I think r palakadam raadhu kadha
X=false
Wow. I love your teaching. I tested my self on a lot of binary equations both ways and was getting all of them correct. I’m also a total beginner. Thank you.
Hi Navin, I am a serious fan of you and your videos and the way you teach and finally smartly say &#39;bye bye&#39;. It&#39;s like I am stick with you like glue. Can you please help me to be a python Master.
While changing from Binary to decimal getting traceback errors. I am putting Ob11111 and expecting result as 31 but getting Traceback error,  name error: name &#39;Ob111111&#39;is not defined. Please advise me
X<br>False
For 31-&#39;0b1111&#39;<br>For 52-&#39;0b1001000&#39;<br>For 65- &#39;ob1000001&#39;<br><br><br>For 110011010 -820.<br><br>Manually calculated if any mistakes iam sorry sir.
Answer is False (1728&lt;2000) and False
false
x=(a//4+b**3)&lt;2000 and (b%4!=0)<br>here first we need to finish the operations mentioned in the brackets<br>a//4 is 3 (actual value is 3.75 but this symbol &quot;//&#39; takes only int values)<br>b**3 is b raised to 3 so 1728<br> x=(a//4+b**3) output is 1728+3= 1731<br><br><br>b%4 the remainder is 0<br>(b%4!=0) is false i.e 0 is equal to 0<br>1728 is less than 2000 but the statement as false so it doesn&#39;t satisfy both conditions <br>1728&lt; 2000 and false<br>output of x= false
Thanks I&#39;m 1in the class 👍🏻👍🏻
Output : False
Answer for homework question is false
False
int,float,complex,bool
Answer: False<br>First of all - (//:print the quotient as integer, ** - Power, % - Modulus(Get the remainder), != not equal to)<br>(a // 4 + b**3) &lt; 2000 and (b%4 !=0)<br>= (15 // 4 + 12**3) &lt; 2000 and (12%4 !=0)<br>According to bodmas = 3 + 1728 &lt; 2000 and 0 !=0<br>Hence, = 1731 &lt; 2000 and 0!= 0<br>The first condition is true but the second is false, hence the solution will come as &#39;False&#39;<br>[Do not include brackets in solution]
A = 15<br>B = 12<br>X = (a // 4 + b ** 3) &lt; 2000 and (b % 4 != 0)<br>Ans : False<br>Because<br>( a // 4 + b ** 3) = 1731<br>(b % 4 != 0)  =  [0 = 0] this statement is wrong.....<br>So x = False<br>......................
False
sir you are awesome its just great to have you, i have my cs exam the day after tomorrow and I guess its going to be awesome
I enjoyed it
Binary into Decimal 🤔
answer of quiz is true
False, because 1731&lt;2000 which is true and 12%4!=0 which is false<br>so, True &amp; False which is false
x=false
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
False is the output for quiz question.
output:false
Sir <br>If we want to convert decimal <br>For that which function is used
1731&lt;2000=true  12%4!=0 is false , true and false is false, s0,x=false
the answer is false<br>this is because according to &#39;and&#39; in python <br>if one comes false, the whole statement is false<br>a=15<br>b=12<br>x=(15//4+12**3)&lt;2000 and (12%4 !=0)<br>15//4=3, 12**3=1728 3+1728=1731<br>1731&lt;2000 is true<br>12%4!=0<br>as 12 exactly goes with 4 without remainder, 12%4 = 0<br>12%4!=0 means 12%4 is not equal to 0 but that is false because it is equal to 0<br>so true and false, there is one false, so the final value of x is false
The question which you have given in last , its answer is false
False
a,b =15,12<br>x = (a//4 + b**3)&lt;2000 and (b%4  !=0)<br>False<br>resion= <br> (a//4 + b**3)= 1731 &lt;2000    -True<br>(b%4 !=0)   - False <br>True and False = False
The answer is false
Decimal - int( ), Binary - bin( ), Octal - oct( ), Hexa Decimal - hex( )<br>The important thing is not only you can convert between decimal and the respective number system but also between any number system.<br>For example - between Binary and Octal, Hexa Decimal and Binary etc.
the answer of quiz output is x false
False as b%4= 0
false... we used and operator
Sir you have not mention one point that if. The number is Even then it will be 0 And if the number is Odd then it will be 1
very awesome series, I was so confused when I started learning python because of all the information on youtube that is not organized and most of the videos weren&#39;t as helpful, thanks for the series I enjoy learning every day, cant wait to finish and start my career as a python developer. thank you.
true and false<br>and function<br>1,0<br>false
Till this episode I was thinking he says &quot;welcome back idiots&quot; because of the accent and my bad phone speaker, but it was aliens all along...
Output of the quiz question:<br>False<br>Reason:<br>x is assigned to two conditions , one is true and another one is false . The logical operator &quot;and &quot; gives output as &quot;false&quot; for true and false conditions
Repekt
Homework Completed 😀 <br>Conversion of decimal to binary <br>31 - Ob11111<br>52 - Ob110100<br>65 - Ob1000001<br>And the conversion of binary to decimal<br>Ob110011010 - 410
Sir Output is True because both the condition is satisfying as True and True = True. Sir let me know whether my answer is correct or wrong
The Quiz Answer is False Because the first condition (15//4 + 12**3)&lt;2000 it is true because (1731&lt;2000) 1731 is lesser than 2000 . And the Second Condition (12%4 !=0) it is False Because 12%4 is 0   (0 != 0) zero is equal to zero .So the Final Output is False Because one condition is true and one is false .
False
false
homework is complete <br>cheak my answers<br>bin(31)=0b11111<br>bin(52)=0b110100<br>110011010 is 410<br>i do it in my rough copy
Please upload video on hashmap and hashtable of python
Answer is False cause in the two conditions, first condition is True as the total is less than 2000 and in the second condition is False as in the given condition 0 != 0. So in And operator if the two cases are True then overall condition will be True or else it is False.
great video, great teaching skills. thank you a lot keep it going.
a = 15<br>b = 12<br><br>x=(a//4 + b**3)&lt;2000 and (b%4 != 0)<br><br>x = 1731&lt;2000 and ( 0 != 0)<br>x = true and false<br>x = false<br><br>As true AND false will result false.
quiz ans -&gt; False because we are performing some operation in x and that is relational that why after comparing we see b%4 == 0 and in code it&#39;s not equal to zero so ans is False
the output will be false if u add print(x).

nice explanation
sir we can use swap in coding to swap the two variables
jugaad method for swapping
Wonderful the concept of swapping variables is really amazing👌. You have explained with different concepts to execute this and it&#39;s clear to me now specially the rot_two(). Thank you very much for such efforts❤
Op swapping
Ehmmm Sir... I didn’t quite get the meaning of bits<br>You didn’t explain what they were

Great
The problem with these tutorials is that, because of strong enthusiasm to teach resulting to high pitch and pausing is already forgotten it makes it difficult to digest in one go. Good tutorial though!
Very good explanation...short vedios are creating intrest to watch more.Thank you
To understand the 2nd method at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpJrMtxYeo&amp;t=1m50s"">1:50</a> I thought of a story.<br>Just imagine that you have two rods and also two stickers called &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.<br>You take the rod with a length of 5 and paste the sicker &quot;A&quot; on it.<br>Then you take the other rod with a length of 6 and paste the sicker &quot;B&quot; on it.<br>Now you join the two, which is with a length of 11, you leave the sticker &quot;A&quot; on it and remove the sticker &quot;B&quot;.<br>Now you cut away the pole from the joint and paste the sticker &quot;B&quot; on the side of the length with 5.<br>You leave the sticker &quot;A&quot; on the side with a length of 6.<br><br>If you could visualize this you will understand this method easily.

Superb explanation...you are the best among all which i have seen..<br>Can you please share a notes or pdf if you have
sir i did understand this video where did you do the coding
bkl
Can someone clarify me this doubt:<br>Till the last video, Mr. Navin has used IDLE to execute a code. In this Video, Pycharm is being used. Can someone tell the reason behind. <br><br>Since am not from computers background, I couldn&#39;t understand where to use Pycharm and IDLE.  Do they both differ from each other? If so, which one is best. <br>Thanks in Advance
when you wrote &quot;print a&quot; and enter why did it go to next line and not print a<br>&#39;
Sir How this swapping perform by using input function
sir how to swap 2 no. by taking value from user?
sir which interpreter you are using
Thanks anna
Why 11 occupies more bits than 6?? In other languages every int occupies same no of bits
Is it just me or somebody else also didn&#39;t quite understand this video...also this python tab seems unfamiliar as i was using idle following his previous videos.
Is we can use this method to swap two tuples too?
Thanks for explaining variety of swapping
can you explain a=a^b,b=a^b,a=a^b is how its work any  logic  inside on it, because its work for me
bubye is missing.....
thank you for making these videos.
Awesome teaching
this was not on idle ..so I got confused somebody here  can help me out with this
a=5<br>b=6<br>a,b=b,a<br>after printing <br>a=6 <br>b=5 as output
Hello sir.. Just curious..<br>If we take 2 input from user <br>n1 and n2<br>and without doing any operations we just print<br>First <br>print(n2)<br>print(n1)<br><br>Will it work na..<br>And can pass all the test cases and also<br>Time and space complexity will also be less..<br>Please correct me if am wrong...
sir can you tell me which software you install in these video
thank you so much! i just spent half an hour trying to understand my professor&#39;s analogy for variable swapping. this was straightforward and comprehensive, thank you!!!

You are really awesome sir teaching way is excellent, while iam studying final year iam fearing about python course but when I saw ur videos it&#39;s very easy 😁
Generally I am not interested to give a comments but this time after seeing this video I can&#39;t  keep myself calm 🔥
Did you do this codes in pycharm
Sir, your mental thinking is unbeleavable
Could you explain swap 2 variables in python?
But speak in bengali
Give more videos
a+=b<br>a-=b<br>a-=b<br>Why it doesn&#39;t work
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpJrMtxYeo&amp;t=2m10s"">2:10</a> That formula.. <br>Had I seen this video before my mindtree interview I might have stand a chance to clear the TR round I failed in it and in last he showed me that formula 😭
how can we swap places of the numbers like 18425 to 18245  and 18425 to 18524 can you help with this
Unbelievable it&#39;s all free.
Amazing ...you make it so simple...u have deep knowledge❤️
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpJrMtxYeo&amp;t=0m00s"">0:00</a> alien&#39;s ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
very much helpful, thank you.
it&#39;s easier than you think, you can just fool the client by doing this:<br>print(&#39;The value of a is &#39;+str(b))<br>print(&#39;The value of b is &#39;+str(a))
Sir, I don&#39;t just understand how you shifted to ide from idle
i have been learning alot from your videos sir ......your way of teaching is awesome, learnt more in 13 videos than in any other year

Thank you very much for having such great and quality lessons for programming for free. I have donated a little amount, but surely it’s absolutely nothing compared to what you’re providing to us. I’m a college student and started watching your Java programming videos just to understand the class explanation. But your videos not only explained it with ease, they brought an interest in me to explore and learn more. And guess what? I started my parallel interest in python too! Thank you very much once again sir and we all students hope you keep uploading superb content like this so that programming becomes a fun, challenging mind game for us!
Very nice sir. Your speaking power, knowledge, techniques are really awesome. It is really helpful. Thanks a lot for everything. Salute to you.

I observer how the views decrease with each subsequent tuorial. People start with great enthusiasm but most of them end up getting demotivated. I guess that classifies us as a winner or a loser
Anybody join in live session if so how is it tell me??
I don&#39;t know if it works for IDLE on windows, but if you are using python interpreter in linux terminal, you can do:<br><br>import os<br>os.system(&#39;clear&#39;)
Ni ayya, you should include this, in your first video of this series
Really Helpful videos till now. I suggested my cousin also Keep Going :)
To clear screen <br>We have to import os module by writing<br>import os<br>And then use the in-built function<br>os.system(&quot;cls&quot;)<br>Finally you can keep it as an function cls<br>Like this-<br><br><br>import os<br>def cls():<br>    os.system(&quot;cls&quot;)
Sir couldn&#39;t find options for reverse settings in spyder anaconda
Thanks a lot for this tutorial sir 😊
Sir u r great ....how u know these type of  codings..
you can run all these codes even in vs code and there you already have easy shortcuts for everything and to get the previous command in vs code you can use &#39;Alt&#39;+&#39;Shift&#39;+down-arrow
You can clear the screen if you import os  and use os.system(&#39;cls&#39;) for Windows or os.system(&#39;clear&#39;) for Linux, or, even better add os.system(&#39;cls&#39;) to a function like: <br>import os<br>def cls():<br>    os.system(&#39;cls&#39;)<br>and call cls() whenever you need it.
I clear the python shell by using &quot;Ctrl + Alt + L&quot;  in my Ubuntu terminal. Try &#39;Ctrl + L&#39;  in other OS if &quot;Ctrl + Alt + L&quot; doesn&#39;t work<br><br>Alternative Option:<br><br>def cls():<br>    print(&quot;\n &quot; * 100)<br><br>cls()  <br><br># Call cls() whenever you want to clear the screen. This just prints 100 black lines and imitates as if it is clearing the screen.
Thank you bro...!!!A.. great platform to learn python...🥰

I was learning python and there is no tilde key in my 60% keyboard xD had to use OSK for tilde xD and the content is very good, i am hoping to clear some tech interviews of python in the future month.
25&amp;30 = 24. Bitwise &amp; cus 25/30  000011000 and binary of 24 gives 1110001
binary number of 13 I got only 1101. I don&#39;t know how you get 00001101. can you explain
now my book is crystal clear.I can understand Bitwise Operators. Thanks a lot
Thank you Sir. <br>It was really helpful.
~n=-n-1
In this question 25^30 How to answer is 7 can anyone tell me?
But when we do ~1 in system it gives -2 it supposed to be 0 ryt
Sir,why you put four zero in starting?<br>ie: 00001100<br>Plz reply
Why we are using 12 as 00001100 but not simply as 1100
you deserve an award
12 binary is 1100 so how come 00001100😢 please explain it
Nice
10th October 2023
Excellent the way and methods by which you have taught the operators in python it helped easy grasping and implementation of the basics👌. Just awesome, love the way you teach❤
sir, 12 bin is 1100<br>i think i&#39;m right
your video is outstanding. I am from Bangladesh
25 ^ 30 = 7<br>We should convert obtained binary into normal number
why using binary of 12 as  00001100 when it is 1100
25^30 =7
how is int value of &#39;11110011&#39; (-13)?
why are you takeing 4 zero in binary format 0000 1100
But for exam we need proper program sir so pls compile in new file sir 😢 but I r excellent professor😊
You are a very good teacher.
25^30=000000111<br>Because bin (7)is 111
After watching this video, i have 1 doubt.<br><br>After solving left shift of 10 &amp; 2, we got ans as 40. you only used binary format of 10 but what about 2?<br><br>I&#39;m enjoying your free course and it&#39;s worth effective. It would be very nice if someone clarifies my doubt
Sir if we a negative number in compliment what happens
Excellent teaching
Awesome 👏 session sir
How to get binary codes
how do we prove that ~13 is -14
i dont know about computer and developing, but sir, you teach us from A,B,C,D<br>LOVE FROM PAKISTAN
16   8   4   2   1 <br>1     1   0   0   1 = 25<br>1     1   1   1   0 = 30<br>0     0   1   1   1 = 7
best online tutor ever, period.
I am new to coading so when i Googled and checked how to convert numbers to binary it shows 12 as 1100 and 13 is 1101 can you help me understand from where the first 4 zeros in 12 came ie 00001100
It would be better to describe each operator with a general example i.e., where can we use ~.<br>Python essentials by netacad is a very good program but at some point I don&#39;t understand and need some guidance. Have a look at it and maybe you can make a video version of the same course (of netacad)
Never thought it so easy....why my mind is so complicated before....thank you now I can keep my mind peace without thinking much about bitwise
I don&#39;t know if it is true or not but what i figured out about ~ is a little different than what he explained. So in python we always start with 0 ryt. like 0 , 1 , 2, 3 , 4 ,5. and for backwards we start like -6, -5, -4 , -3 , -2 , -1. so six places forward and six places backwards. notice that 5 is in the 6th position. and what abt backwards? the sixth position is -6. and that is the compliment of 5.
thank you very much sir for such excellent content
How come u suddenly changed from IDLE? and what is this site?
Awesome the way you teach and a good approach of teaching the concepts first... After I watched your first video, there was no going back or looking for another !! Thank you
Navin you re a hero without a cape , very appreciate for that lectures you deserve the best always .
7 i s the answer for 25^30
yah yahhh
sir  you said for -13 we can write it in binary form like 11110011 but if we write 0b11110011 in IDLE its showing 243,whats the reason for this?
Very nice
what are the uses of left shift and right shift an all ?
You are the just the bestt..!!!! You are lord of the programming. Seriously I paid thousands to learn python but got no clarity. and look here this is freee and in the best representation!!! thanks naveen sir! you are doing a great job!
Thank You Sir for your Guidance 🙂I am School Student preparing for my future 😌You are making my efforts easy Navin Sir,So Thank You So Much😌😌
homework :<br>Q:25 ^ 30<br>ANS: 11001<br>          11110<br>          <i>_____</i><br>           00111<br><br>00111 = 7 ans.
Sir compliment of 11 is -12 .The binary form of number 11 is 00001011 and compliment of it(-12) is 11110100.but compliment of 12 is 11110011 an if we  subtract 1we get 11110010 which doesnot which doesnot match with it .Please anyone help with this
How 32 and 8 comes I didn&#39;t understand sir
Why there is four zeros in front
Good teaching👏<br>But<br>By using this Telusko python course 🤔🤔<br>Can we get the job ??
I didn&#39;t understand complement concept... 12 binary number is 1100 but you said 00001100...  Can you explain me please???
Thanks!
Sir how we will come to know the id no. Of 25 and 30
Print(&quot;master....&quot;)
Why is bin(12) = 00001100 instead of 0b1100? Can someone help address this please? Thank you.
Thank you sir, I got it
I haven&#39;t studied this concept and after watching about 3 times I totally understood this.. thank you so much sir..🤗
Sir plz give some Assignment HW to practice....<br>I loved ur Videos ❤️
👍
sir binary of 12 is 1100 right how is it 00001100?
why  is compliment of 0 = -1 and compliment of 1 = -1. It should have been 1 and 0 respectively rgt?
Sir yaad kaise rakhe in sab ko jaise tuple, logical operators etc
I really liked it was simple and easy
11000 = 24, that&#39;s why we got 24
I have a doubt here, binary of 12 is 1100 right, but we have 0000 1100 here,<br>can anyone please help.
25 &lt;&lt; 2<br>100<br>25 &gt;&gt; 2<br>6<br><br>30 &lt;&lt; 2<br><br>120<br>30 &gt;&gt; 2<br>7
Just Awesome Sir..
thank you ❤
What happens to the adding the second complement (adding +1) to the first complement if the last bit of the first complement is 1?
great video sir
i have a doubt with this one ...the binary value of 12 is 1100 why we add 0000&#39;s before it...
Sir I am not alein 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thanks a lot❤️
bro i was so confused about bitwise now I got it thanks<br>May Allah bless you
Words are not worthy
sir how would add four digit before every binary  numbers
bin (12) is 0b1100 how u r getting 00001100?
i am very scared of coding but after watching your videos I got full confidence in myself that I can also learn programming language. thank you so much sir.
Very well explained!!!!
My question is what is the practical use for bitwise operators?
Well, if we convert 12 into binary just the way you taught us in the previous videos, its turning iut to be 1100.. can someone please help me with this?
Thank you sir
learning in 22 thanks you alot  sir this course is just full with energy.
print(&quot;Thanks a lot,sir&quot;)
Sir, why do you consider only  2^5 +2^3 = 40 at left shift operator concept?
You are my love
Bro your voice is like a toddler teaching. Love it

Left shift and Right shift are night mares to me(becoz they come in Written test for freshers) don&#39;t know I may be ignored to listen this concept while teaching in class becoz it comes in last of these topics and gets bored in classroom may be...but now it is really easy for me becoz even though it comes last and becoz i am watching your lecture i never gets bored till the end of video that&#39;s why i learnt this simple concept 😁
If anyone confused<br><br>-X = 2&#39;s complement of X<br>2&#39;s complement = 1&#39;s Complement of X + 1
hi
Thank you so..much for the explanation SIR !! ✨🌸
it is very neat and clean explaination.🙌🙌
Nice teaching 😊

Sir, your given some questions in video end but it&#39;s getting different answers manual calculation and python compiler calculations  2nd questions that is 125|265 as for python it&#39;s getting 381 I&#39;m calculated manually it&#39;s getting 365 what&#39;s the problem could you explain
best video
I have a doubt, how come the value of sqrt(25) is showing 5.0 in python I mean why is it in float?
Your videos are mind blowing. I still cannot understand how you can teach such python concepts so easily.
sir, Could you tell where we need to use math function. If we use math infront of round like math.round in print statement. it is showing an error
thank you for making these videos.
but it is defining the square root values
import math as m<br>print(math.sqrt(25)) <br>This doesn&#39;t work when written individually in a new project... But works fine when we type in the series just the way is done in the video... Why is it so?
sir, I am a beginner in python language and I am facing problem in practicing python. Like the inbuild functions you have <br>taught till now, I want to practice them but I need different question for it. So can you please make some questions for the beginners who have watched your videos till now. Actually it is very hard to find the question on the specific topics which we have studied till  now. We can&#39;t right away start any project questions as we don&#39;t have enough knowledge. Hence I request you to upload some topic based questions so that we can practice them at home and get perfection in python under your guidance.
Fabulous teaching

I wish you were my teacher. I am do lost in python is really not safe. Worst I have an exam coming up. 😢
is pycharm safe sir
Awesome, you have nicely explained the differences between writing a code in an interactive environment and in an IDE, how to trace code line by line and debug it which is really important from foundation building point of view👍. Just loved it🥰<br>Five functions from math module --&gt;<br>math.pow() = calculates the power of something like 2**3 = 8<br>math.sqrt() = calculates the square root of something like sqrt(64) = 8<br>math.pi = Gives us the constant value of PI<br>math.ceil() = gives max value of a given number ex.- ceil value of 3.6 is 4<br>math.floor() = gives min value of a given number ex.- floor value of 3.6 is 3

Navin its not working on window 11 <br><br>cd Onedrive/
Your content is great, its just that for me f8 is not working. Any suggestion.
.
Breakpoint explained so nicely
when i write cd Desktop, it says &quot;the system cannot find the path specified&quot;. what should i do to solve this problem? my laptop is ASUS.
Math functions- sqrt (finds the square root of a no), factorial (finds factorial of a no), pow (a,n) (computes a^n), sin(x) (computes sin of the input in radians), ceil( finds the upper approximation of a no)
plss tell or make a  video for that
the debug is not working in python IDLE
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akcEaEH91gI&amp;t=6m20s"">6:20</a>... when he said &quot;you can see now we got our PyCharm&quot;, it sounded like python (like mamba) and I was dead scared for a moment. 🤣🤣 Jokes aside... I am only going one way with his tutorials, that is forward and next and next! THANKS Navin and Telusko!!

thanks for your valuable free tutorials
I&#39;ve been using Sublime instead of PyCharm, is it okay?
I appreciate the video provided by the professor, but when I was requested to input F8 and I clicked on Run, I was unable to locate F8. Could you kindly assist?
Really you are an excellent teacher
No paid course sir, start begginers in your channel is correct 💯 👍🏿👍🏿
Thank you Navin Reddy, you are the best ! All your videos are incredibly useful and are helping a lot
Where are you from sir?
print(&quot;amazing python lectures delivered by Navin sir&quot;)
I need teachers like you for every subject!
whoever is having a problem  running it  on the command prompt for windows10/11 ,possibly your desktop directory is through dropbox/onedrive so in that case create a new folder on your desktop( existing folder can also work) and go to the properties, see the path, cd and every path name and lastly cd desktop and then the same process in the video to run the code.
Answer for homework question is &#39;sqrt&#39;=gives square root of the value<br>&#39;pow(a,b)&#39;=power value like 2^3<br>&#39;ceil(a)&#39;=ceil value is the biggest value of the float value<br>&#39;floor(a)&#39;=floor value is the smallest value of float <br>&#39;trignometeric function&#39;s&#39;=gives the trigonometric value
I love the way you teach. I was a noob before bt now I m learning and loving Python. Thank you sir.
Thank you , interesting
Something big in learning Python can just be about knowing how to use an IDE...Thank you Navin for this wonderful videos.

If I press F8  it is not going to next line in debugging? Is there any other key for python 10
The way of teaching is awesome ♥️
Quiz Answer 😀<br>5 functions of math are<br>1) sqrt() - It is use to take a Square Root of a Number<br>2) power() - it is use to give power to a number (raised to)<br>3) ceil() - it will give u the highest value of an number for Eg: if we enter 2.3 the output will be three .<br>4) floor() - it will give u the lowest value for Eg : if we enter 2.8 the output will be 2<br>5) factorial() - it is used to get factioral of an number

&quot;Thank you for creating such excellent Python tutorials! I&#39;ve been practicing from the beginning and have found them to be very helpful. One thing that would make them even better would be if you could provide practice exercises with answers at the end of each video. This would help me to test my knowledge and reinforce what I&#39;ve learned. Thanks again for all your hard work!&quot;
you are so good at explaining , not irritating like others
This python video is still the best i have watched on youtube. kudos

your teaching system most Extra ordinary?
dude you are amazing. respect and love from Pakistan
can you please explain abt argv
Navin is an illuminati! Did you notice the result of the equation in the background?

whatta a  clear cut explanation<br>loved it!
import math<br>x=int(input(&quot;enter the num&quot;))<br>print(math.pow(x,3))
The lessons are great thank you so much!
awesome explanation
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OX49nLNPEE&amp;t=3m04s"">3:04</a> it is most important basic point which will be questioned in interviews..<br><br>once interviewer asked about it and without proper idea i said it is taking integer type 😂 but later i searched and finds it defaultly takes String type that&#39;s why we use a = int(input(&quot; first num &quot;))
x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number :&quot;))<br>y = pow(x,3)<br>print(&quot;value of cube is :&quot;, y)
The answer for the homework question is <br>-------------------------------------<br>input_in=int(input(&quot;enter the value of the n :&quot;)<br>print(input_in***3)<br>-------------------------<br>Here is the answer
Thank you Sir.
x=int(input(&#39;enter any value : &#39;))<br>print(x**3)<br><br>Output:<br>enter any value : 7<br>343
Comment line ....<br>Import sys<br>a = int(sys.argv[1])<br>Print (a * a * a)<br>....<br>It&#39;s right ?😅...
Multiple inputs
i have used a fx pow(x,3) and haven&#39;t specify any &#39;math&#39; word and still it is working.<br>So this is correct or not ?
Lmao im trying to write 2 lines and enter forcefuly executes it<br>Forcefullyyyy
a=int(input(&quot;Enter the no.&quot;))<br>b=3<br>z=a**b<br>print (&#39;Your Cube is : &#39;,z)
# Cube of a number with input<br><br>cube = int(input(&#39;enter a number&#39;))<br>cube1 = cube * cube * cube<br>print(&quot;The Cube of {0} = {1}&quot;.format(cube, cube1))<br><br># Cube of a number with command line<br>import sys<br>x = int(sys.argv[1])<br>cube = x ** 3<br>print(&quot;The Cube of {0} = {1}&quot;.format(x, cube))<br><br>Thanks a lot!!! Navin -- why didn&#39;t you meet earlier --- tell me Oh God
print(&quot;happy teachers day sir&quot;)
Bro meeru Telugu a?
Genius Navin
anyone could please tell me where i can find the assignments which sir has mentioned ?
My console is not showing input option. Why? I put everything like you
x=int(input(&#39;enter the cube of the number&#39;))<br>y=(x**3)<br>print (y)
Thank you

Sir, what is meant by int (raw_input()).... Plz reply sir
hi, I am facing a problem, whenever i use the input function to  get th answer, I am getting my answer with &quot;&amp;&quot; in it, for example if i write x= input(&quot;enter a name&quot;) and then I write the name in terminal I get the answer like this &quot;haroon&amp;&quot;. if anyone can help , Thanks
Is there any job for software testing fresher?
Is it better to use int() or eval() for user input commands where the user is converting the string into an integer? I have read that int() is preferable.
This man is truly an amazing teacher.
Thank you so much

Hey Navin, I am looking to change my career and I was looking for good mentor who can teach me programming in easy way and here I got your tutorials. Sorry at this moment I can&#39;t donate but I promise when I started earning from my my new career then sure I will. Also your tutorials are awesome <br>Adding to this I a just want to say I am not sure if I am right, when you did ifelse the number was 5 but it directly went to bye but didn&#39;t print &quot;it&#39;s not great&quot;. Can you plz suggest this was right or wrong. <br>All the best for your new tutorials and God bless you
a great  tutorial with an excellent teacher, it was relly helpful^^

what did you mean when you said &quot;I can use my own input or the user input&quot; even when you as for an input I see that you put your own numbers in?
Thank you very much. You are a genius.

I have an issue in pressing F8 after debugging. Does anyone know why?
There are some errors in this code. The print statement at the end is empty, how is it printing in a new line. Sorry for bringing this up, but new programmers like me get confused. lol
Amazing Sir.
thanks man, I was stuck on this problem
You are logical and explicit
Your  teaching style, explanation is very good and easy to remember
That program in simple way:<br>i=1<br>while i&lt;=5:<br>    print(&quot;telusko&quot;, 4*&quot;rocks&quot;)<br>    i=i+1
totally not for beginners
i think thes is the way to teach the language <br>thank so much for sharing this infomations
these fools only explain you what is repetition .. loops can be iterations also ! learn the difference and explain properly
i =1<br>while i&lt;=100:<br>   if i%3!=0 and i%5!=0:<br>       print(i)<br>   i = i +1

yo, this video was really helpful for me , although I am watching this after 5 years but still got my answers , thank you !!!!!!
I did all square numbers between 1-500 in for loop. Tried to do the same in while loop. But the output gives all square numbers with 529 which is &gt;500. Why is 529 coming?

Hey Navin thank you for this wonderful video !!!!!! 😊 <br>Be bit slow please 😅 concepts are well clear but you are doing so fast 😂
Want give suggestions tht most of guyz are not able to understand ur language as u speak very fast. No doubt ur teaching style is gud bt atleast u can speak slowly.
Thank you so much Navin! I totally appreciate the pace and thoroughness of your videos. I&#39;ll be watching!

Thanks a lot your videos really so useful!
Loving this series
Good explanation
answer:<br>for i in range(1, 501):<br>    if i ** 0.5 % 1 == 0:<br>        print(i)

Hi, plz tell me how to write 3 statements in for loop and assign a new value <br>And if cindition which will run after loop completion in the same prog
I wonder if I can use this for a list of lists. If I have some data I want to write to a CSV, maybe I could use a for loop that references each list and writes it as a line in the CSV
There&#39;s so many videos for the basic python concepts, but I finally found someone who talks fast. When people talk too slow, it makes me nervous and agitated because I feel too much anticipation for what they&#39;re about to say. I have too much time to insert my own thoughts and it becomes harder to listen. <br>When someone talks fast enough, the information is denser. Then I can relax and absorb. <br>Fast talkers are soothing
n=int(input (&quot;enter the value&quot;))<br>for i in range (0,n+1):<br>    Perfect_square=i**2<br>    print (Perfect_square)
x = 1<br>while x*x &lt; 500:<br>    print(x*x)<br>    x += 1
Very clear ,and thank you so much

is there something I can particularly improve in this code?<br><br>x = int(input(&quot;give a number&quot;))<br>i = 2<br>while i&lt;x:<br>    if x % i == 0:<br>        print(&quot;it is composite&quot;)<br>        break<br>        i = i+1<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;it is prime&quot;)<br>        break<br>    if i==x:<br>        print(&quot;it is prime&quot;)
Here&#39;s what I have for my Fibonacci solution, but having the user specify how many numbers they&#39;d like as opposed to just using 50:<br><br>counter = 1<br>x = 0<br>y = 1<br><br>length = int(input(&#39;How many Fibonacci numbers would you like to print? &#39;))<br><br>while counter &lt;= length:<br>    print(x)<br>    x, y = y, x + y<br>    counter += 1
1)<br>n=int(input(&quot;Enter the number of terms: &quot;))<br>a=0<br>b=1<br>if n&lt;=0:<br>    print(&quot;The Output of your input is&quot;,a)<br>else:<br>    print(a,b,end=&quot; &quot;)<br>    for x in range(2,n):<br>        c=a+b<br>        print(c,end=&quot; &quot;)<br>        a=b<br>        b=c
I just wanna say you make python easy
for i in range(1,101):<br><br>    if i%2!=1:<br>        print(i)    is this ok ?
for fibonacci sequence<br>x=0<br>y=1<br>z=x+y<br>a=int(input(&quot;counter:&quot;))<br><br>print(x)<br>print(y)<br>for i in range(1,a-1):<br>    print(z)<br>    x=y<br>    y=z<br>    z=x+y<br><br>    i+=1<br>   <br>  print(&quot;Thank You&quot;)<br>  break<br><br>for checking if prime<br><br>x=int(input(&#39;x:&#39;))<br>for i in range(2,x):<br>    if x%i==0:<br>        print(&quot;not prime&quot;)<br>        break<br>    if i==x-1:<br>        print(&#39;prime&#39;)
bro was that a 10 mins or 1 min video it went like vroom
for i in range(1,20):<br>    if i%3!=0 and i%5!=0:<br>        print(i)
Start Ai&amp;Ml
after so much struggle it was only this easy:<br><br> x = int(input(&#39;enter a number:&#39;))<br>if x%2==0 or x%3==0 or x%5==0 or x%7==0:<br>    print(&#39;it is not a prime number&#39;)<br><br>else:<br>    print(&#39;it is a prime number&#39;)
2)   x = int(input(&quot;enter the value&quot;))<br><br>for i in range(2,x):<br>    if x%i == 0:<br>        print(&quot;not prime&quot;)<br>        break<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;prime&quot;)
welcome back alliens nice intro
To find prime number or not                                                                                                                                                                                  <br><br>p = 2<br>x = int(input(&quot;Please enter a number to find out whether it is prime number or not = &quot;))<br>if p - x == 0:<br>    print(&quot;it is prime number&quot;)<br>elif x &lt;= 2:<br>    print(x, &quot;It is not prime number&quot;)<br><br>elif x % 1 == 0 and x % 2 != 0:<br>    print(x, &quot;it is prime number&quot;)<br><br>else:<br>    print(&quot;It is not prime number&quot;)
2) prime or not<br> p=int(input(&quot;enter the number&quot;))<br><br>i=1<br>while(i&lt;=1):<br>    if(i==p):<br>        print(&quot;p is a prime&quot;)<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;p is a not prime&quot;)<br>    i=i+1
this video = 100/100 (:
why do we write i=i+1
Why don&#39;t we use i++ in python??
Trainers like you should teach in college. 🙂
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCZBnjF4_tU&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a><br>Sir is it okay, if we print the available number of candies first so that the user understand how many candies are there , so user can enter desirable amount with in our stock
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fibonacci"">#Fibonacci</a> series<br><br>x = 0<br>y = 1<br>print(x) <br>print(y) <br>for z in range(1, 9) :<br>      z = x + y<br>      print(z) <br>      x = y<br>      y = z
Good evening sir, I have a doubt. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCZBnjF4_tU&amp;t=4m38s"">4:38</a> if I enter the value of x as 3, after printing candy 3 times it also shows out of stock which is unnecessary.  How to deal with that ?
Sir I am in 7th grade and you are one of the best coding teacher ever as well as your examples make easy to understanding coding in py.
I now feel like I am really an alien 👽
a=int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;))<br>for i in range(2,a):<br>    if a%i==0:<br>        print(&quot;not prime&quot;)<br>        break<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;Prime&quot;)<br>        break
Somehow when I print out of stock, the word &quot;Out of Stock&quot; does not come out
Program to print prime numbers??
Thanks 🌹
thanks for the video
2nd question answer i got the answer  BUT IS THIS CORRECT WAY..........?????<br>i=int(input(&quot;enter any number:&quot;))<br>if i%2 ==0 :<br>    print(&quot;is even number&quot;)<br>else:<br>    i&gt;=2<br>    print(&quot;is odd number&quot;)

Sir I am Agrim of class 8 and I want to learn python because I like coding and programming (as you say programming is so fun😉)and I am learning by your videos. Thank you a lot sir and please keep guiding us.
pass acts as a place holder

Love you brother but I want several programs based on every concept (strings, list, tuple, set, dictionary ,etc) in python so if it is possible then make a video or give me a suggestion that where can I find the programs based on the concept.
It is not coming while using or and
hi Naveen in this video &quot;and&quot; function with &quot;if&quot; will remove only those value which are divisible with &quot;3 and 5&quot;... like 15,30,45,60,75,90 this will not remove 3, 5, 9,12 etc.
how could a fresher do fibonacci series.
Video is not clarity, make sure that video should be clarity
Navin sir awesome
Print fibonacci numbers:-<br>import sys<br><br>fib1=0<br>fib2=1<br>end_num=int(sys.argv[1])<br>for i in range(1,end_num):<br>    <br>    if fib2&gt;=end_num:<br>        break<br>    elif fib2&lt;=end_num:<br>        print(&#39;i value is:&#39;,i)<br>        print(&#39;fib1,fib2 valus are:&#39;,fib1,fib2)<br>        result=fib1+fib2<br>        print(fib2)<br>        fib1=fib2<br>        fib2=result<br>    else:<br>        break

why can&#39;t we use for instead of while?
I can&#39;t understand if he is Indian, American, Mexican or an egg.
Thank you very much. You are a genius.

In colleges there are many lectures how can teach well, not all ,but the problem is the environment, there will many people surrounded us,so we won&#39;t even get the intrest mainly (girls)😘😘😘😘😘
Why didn&#39;t the if statement refer to x but rather to i ? Please I need explanation
Could you add concepts like list comprehension, and optionhandller?
Can we also use pass replace continue in the last case ?
Thanks to you for your help<br>Thanks for your own pleasure
Could have better explanation for pass
I didn&#39;t understand pass
#22.2<br>I was bothered by how long it took to check numbers in the hundreds of billions, but in adjusting for that it didn&#39;t work for numbers under 10 or squares of primes, so the code is a touch long in exchange for high speed with larger numbers.<br><br><br>from math import sqrt<br>x = int(input(&#39;Enter a number to check primeness: &#39;))<br>while x &lt; 10:<br>    if x != 2 and x != 3 and x != 5 and x != 7:<br>        print(x, &#39;is not prime.&#39;)<br>    else:<br>        print(x, &#39;is prime.&#39;)<br>    break<br><br>if x &gt;= 10:<br>    if sqrt(x) != int(sqrt(x)):<br>        r = range(2, int(sqrt(x)))<br>        for n in r:<br>            if x % n == 0:<br>                print(x, &#39;is not prime.&#39;)<br>                break<br>            elif n == int(sqrt(x))-1:<br>                print(x, &#39;is prime.&#39;)<br>                break<br>    else:<br>        print(x, &#39;is not prime.&#39;)
whitout using continue it prints the same so not getting properly whts the diff
This is how I understood the three concepts.<br><br>break - terminates the loop, or comes out of the loop<br>continue - goes to the start of the loop<br>pass - as the word suggests, goes to the next step in the loop
this was really awesome, I really enjoyed it .
Answer:<br>(a)<br><br><br>a=0<br>b=1<br>for i in range(50):<br>    print(a)<br>    print(b)<br>    a = a + b<br>    b = b + a<br><br>(b)<br><br>a = int(input(&quot;Enter any number: &quot;))<br>b = 0 <br>for i in range(1, a + 1):<br>    if a % i == 0:<br>        b += 1   <br>if b == 2:<br>    print(a, &quot; is a prime number&quot;)<br>else:<br>    print(a, &quot; is a composite number&quot;)
In pass scenario<br>If value of i is odd then pass that block<br>But also in even value of i if statement doesn&#39;t executed 😂<br>Conclusion : ignore all the value of i in if statement<br>And print all the value of i by using else
x = int(input(&quot;Enter an integer:&quot;))<br>count = 0<br>for i in range(1, x+1):<br>    if x % i == 0:<br>        count += 1<br>if count == 2:<br>        print(x, &quot;is a prime number&quot;)<br>else:<br>    print(x, &quot;is a composite number&quot;)
i = 0<br>j = 1<br>k = 0<br>while k &lt; 50:<br>    ans = i + j<br>    print(ans)<br>    i = j<br>    j = ans<br>    k += 1
Can we have also C language?
Your are professional 💜👌👌👌

I like your delivery style. For some reason Indian people present this stuff better for me. Thanks for the concise explanation.
I hope you will reply me, I&#39;ve been watching your sequels of python to learn and I&#39;ve got the below error. I&#39;am trying to print the pc only for the given input times but the the output is printing pc for 6 times inspiete of giving the av value as 5. can you please help me out with this. you&#39;ve tried this using while loop but not for for loop.<br><br><br>a=int(input(&quot;how many times do you want to print&quot;))<br>av = 5<br><br>for i in range(a):<br><br>    if i&gt;av:<br>        break<br>    print(&quot;pc&quot;)<br><br>waiting for your reply.
Thank u for the tutorial. Cheers from Brazil
can someone explain me...why he use * while i&lt;=x*  the 4th line
Why didn&#39;t you use increament operator just after print statement?

Hello<br><br>Here I had a query in candies program, that if there was no sufficient candies (at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCZBnjF4_tU&amp;t=4m42s"">4:42</a>) instead of printing available candies and finally stating  as out of stock, why can&#39;t we say that to the user  as &quot;sorry out of stock &quot; and not to print the available candies as well because the user input is greater than the available  candies in the machine.<br><br>Example: If we went to bank to withdraw and enter the amount, then it will display the output as &quot;not sufficient cash in machine&quot;,  likewise can we do here also. If yes,  could anyone help me out with this program to write a code in that way.

i dont see where you used anything but &quot;pass&#39;?? where is break and continue? Also what exactly does the modulus do %

Sir instead of i+=1  can we write i++
Nice sir
Where I get the assignment questions can any one tell me
we cant use &#39;and&#39; in if statement...because it will give true when both if statements are true. so, its better to use &#39;or&#39; only
We have to use.... &quot;Get lost instead of bye&quot;   ..... I like this very much 🤣😂😅😅<br>Awesome navin reddy bhayya
Yoo guys where do you all get the assignment

Clarified my doubts thankyou so much sir☺️
u just understood a student mindset <br>u know where the student is getting confused and explained it again <br>love u sir
geat clarification with ease! thanks again
you teach too fast, also i have practiced loops and break statements but after watching your video i got very much confused and instead of revising the loop i will have to study loop again. Taught loops very badly, worst quality, time wasted
This one is simple and clear!😎
Sir I don&#39;t get this lecture clearly...😔
University of Telusko!!!
Please make an a video about python road map day by day
Where r the assignments..??
I would need another video to understand the difference between continue and pass.
thank you so much it really helped me to understand the &quot;Pass&quot;❤
Hi Naveen, I hope you are doing well. I am very glad to say that, the videos are fabulous and helpful to those who are aspiring to learn python. I have a query ,that &quot;continue&quot; keyword giving error during while loop.<br>The code is:<br>x=1<br>while x&lt;=10:<br>          if x==5:<br>                    continue<br>          print(x)<br>          x+=1<br><br>But it is working while using for loop. <br>Thank you
But little bit not understand pass statement
When we print the function fun( ) which has only a &quot;pass&quot; inside, it prints &quot;None&quot;
I have prepared 3 sets of codes to understand break, continue and pass. Copy the whole thing paste, run and enjoy!!!<br><br># This one is to understand - Break<br>for i in range(5):<br>    if i ==3:<br>        print(&quot;From here it goes out of the loop&quot;)<br>        break<br>    print(&quot;Hello&quot;, i)<br>print(&quot;Did you understand how &#39;break&#39; works?&quot;)<br><br># This one is to understand - Continue<br>print(&#39;\n&#39;)<br>for i in range(5):<br>    if i ==3:<br>        print(&quot;From here it goes back to the beginning of the loop&quot;)<br>        continue<br>    print(&quot;Hello&quot;, i)<br>print(&quot;Did you understand how &#39;continue&#39; works?&quot;)<br><br># This one is to understand - Pass<br>print(&#39;\n&#39;)<br>for i in range(5):<br>    if i ==3:<br>        print(&quot;This is the missing 3&quot;)<br>        pass<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;Hello&quot;, i)<br>print(&quot;Did you understand how &#39;pass&#39; works?&quot;)
to print first 50 fibonacci number : <br>num = int (input(&quot;enter the range:&quot;))<br>num1 = 0<br>num2 = 1<br>print(num1)<br>print(num2)<br>for i in range (num):<br>    num3 = num1 + num2<br>    num1 = num2<br>    num2 = num3<br>    print (num3)
You must have explained break,continue and mainly pass for a real or the same problem unlike anything <a href=""http://random.my/"">random.My</a> common sense still unable to connect with the pass for your particular example.
Clear cut explanation ✌✌☺👏
pass is simply a null statement.
Thank u sir🤗
Sir your teaching skills is so fantastic and accurate but sir can you make a video on all program of phython please
❤️ touchinggg
Can you tell u pass concept again
I am getting different results in idle and jupyter notebook. Why is it so?
this mod key is not working in my pycharm software. can anyone tell me the alternative for it. its version is 2021.2 as given on its website.<br>if the problem is something else please help.
I&#39;m confuse in pass
Thanks for the excellent content!
reddy garu super clarification
Can we use continue in a while loop ? I tried but was not able to  get desired output because I&#39;m facing problem in the updation part. So , is there any way of using continue?
I am 14 years old I love python I dint know where to start I started in many websites then I saw some in YouTube then I saw your channel and I am loving it
Appreciate your dedication in answering to people&#39;s query and helping them out.
from array import*<br>a=array(&#39;i&#39;,[10,45,34,27,71,81])<br>b=array(&#39;i&#39;,[])<br>c=2<br>for i in a:<br>	if i !=a[c]:<br>		b.append(i)<br>print(b)
To satisfied any condition and execute the code we use continue <br>And if you don&#39;t have anything to devlop but you would to mention any block for future use, you can use pass to keep empty block in the code
Pls make some lec videos on how to make gui panels in python. Your videos are awesome.
Yaa I want another video on pass 🙏
Continue : when the condition arises that it is need to move to next iteration instead reading further code. <br>Break: When it is need to terminate the code when desire output achieved. <br>Most important and u missed it both videos. <br>Pass: When it is need to read further code as well instead of current block is necessary then we will simply pass it to nxt block. But in continue it will start it again and in break it will terminate the block. In pass it will give importance to next block when particular condition arises. That’s it. Poor examples.
Thanks, now it&#39;s clear.
sir instead of using pass we can also comment that code also . am i right
Thank you sir, i am clear with the difference between break &amp; continue... But when you are explaining the pass: you took an example of defining a function and you explained... But defining a function and what it does and all, you did not tell till this point of tutorial... so i am confused about the functions, what it does or where to define/use the function. <br>Pls let me know <br><br>Thank you
Simply and clearly! Thank you!
Great!
Sir make mcq questions for infosys paper on python
He always uses for loop in case of continue statement but never explained why (in while even the increment will get skipped )
I need more clear xplanation navin brother
Thanks for sharing your skills thanks a lot sir
Why to use pass? We can simply comment that function or class if we don&#39;t want it to be used. So, what is the significance of pass?
sir may I know<br>if I want to print only even output <br>I don&#39;t want to print odd numbers<br>how will you do that
In the description I have checked, but could not find anything!

thank you very much
Is studying mca after bsc physics hard ? Can anyone pls tell me .
Thank you so much...but i don&#39;t understand pass
can you plzz explain<br> &#39;pass&#39;  more clearily
Dear friends better you write a code as below and just change break, continue and pass and check the results urself, i was thinking continue and pass both are same but NO both are different, ex: code you to practice find below<br><br>for i in range (100):<br>    print(i)<br>    if i&gt;5:<br>        pass<br>    else:<br>        print (&quot;hello&quot;)<br>    print(&quot;Dont print in break Continue &amp; print in pass&quot;)<br>print(&quot;bye&quot;)
Sir, ur for loops tutorial was very lacking and it didnt explain it properly
@Navin sir this 22.1 it really cleared my doubts.. Actually i cannot understand the previous video thank for clearing the concept
Thnx Mr navin reddy sir u deserve more success in ur life may god bless you ☺️☺️👍✨
This Video, Sir read the mind of their students ahead and presented again. Cleared and avoided confusions, especially between continue and pass . :)
Sir, you make us fall in love with python

Hi Sir, thank you so much for your effort for making a tutorial .. I&#39;m done watching Django and I learn a lot and now I&#39;m starting python.
Can you please tell me the difference between continue and pass
Missing u at the corner☺
Thank you so much for the video , Its quiet informative , But when tried practice a lot of programs . there are few error , could you please help
Which book we have to purchase for practicing python programs. I am unable to download pycharm.
Can we also do high level projects from python
it was more than enough to solve my doubt      : )
Sir you are so good .. keep continuing
Pass and continue works similar ??
Waoh, u just answered my stuck.....was literally challenged, can now easily use the 3 words comfortably
You are the best.
Please teach about graphics and animation course  also sir

You are such a life saver sir.. i was struggling with this topic. since you taught from the scratch I understood it properly..thankyou so much
I&#39;ve been desiring to learn python and am really privilege to have come across Telusko.. have committed to follow this tutorials from 1 now am in 23 and the approach used is really easy to understand. Thank you so much for the nice work done.
By far the best technical teacher I have seen. Navin, keep your passion for technology and teaching going. You have a gift and you are a gift!
# 1st Problem:<br><br>for i in range(1,5):<br>    for j in range(i,5):<br>        print(j,end = &#39; &#39;)<br>    print()<br><br><br><br># 2nd problem:<br><br>a=&quot;ABCD&quot;<br>b=&quot;PQR&quot;<br>for i in range (4):<br>    for j in range (3):<br>        res1 = a[0:i+1]<br>        res2 = b[i:j+3]<br>        print(res1 + res2)<br>        break
really great
for i in range(4):<br>    print(i + 1, end=&quot;&quot;)<br>    if i==3:<br>        print()<br>        for j in range(3):<br>            print(j + 1, end=&quot;&quot;)<br>            if j == 2:<br>                print()<br>                for k in range(2):<br>                    print(k + 1, end=&quot;&quot;)<br>                    if k == 1:<br>                        print()<br>                        for l in range(1):<br>                            print(l + 1, end=&quot;&quot;)

Great explanation. I was able to simpify this even more using the following:<br><br>for i in range(4):<br>    print(&quot;# &quot; * 4)<br><br>for i in range(4):<br>    print(&quot;# &quot; * (i+1))<br><br>for i in range(4):<br>    print(&quot;# &quot; * (4-i))
for i in range(4):<br>    for j in range(4-i):<br>        print(i+j+1,end=&#39;&#39;)<br>    print()<br><br>Output:<br><br>1234<br>234<br>34<br>4
if some gets a error msg use if u added a print()  in last line if you use end=&quot; &quot;
great explanation sir..... thanks i got it...🤗🤗

Superb explanation 🙌🙌
Sir could you please give a working code for the second assignment question, actually I tried hard but could not hit the logic for the pattern completely.
for i  in range (1,5)<br>    for j in range (i,5)<br>       print (j, end =&quot;&quot;)<br>print()
For the last part, may i know how to start with ## not # ?
For I in range(4) :<br>Print(&quot;# # # #&quot;) <br>Vl gives you this answer too
sir sir how good ur .the only channel i used to make a comment

nums=[1,2,3,4]<br>i=nums<br>for i in range:<br>    if i%2==0:<br>        print(i) <br>can someone tell why this doesnt work ?
In the given code, the line if num % 5 == 0: checks if the remainder of num divided by 5 is equal to 0. It means that the numbers being checked are divisible by 5 without any remainder. If the condition is true, the number is printed.
Heyy..its showing unsupported operand type(s) for % : list and int?????
thanks for the video
Please explain this my doubt ...<br><br>list = [1,2,3,5,10,13]<br>for i in list:<br>    if i % 5 == 0:<br>        print(i)      <br>else:<br>    print(&quot;not found&quot;)<br><br>Here i want to print all the values which is divisable by 5 , so i didn&#39;t use break... if nothing is matching the condition then only i need to print &quot;Not found&quot; ... but my above code gives below result which is not expected. in this case how else statement is executed here ? <br><br>Output : <br>5<br>10<br>not found
Best video to clear concepts. Was taught 5 times before by several other teachers/friends/toppers but still this concept was not clear. You cleared it within 5 mins, along with the usage, application and basically everything.
Literally the only thing keep me sane these days is your lessons.

Haven&#39;t understood why it is printing 10 and not found, after removing break
Hello, suppose when we don&#39;t use break in this code and if there is any match with condition then condition logic is executing and else part is also executing so my question is that When does the flow come on else part??(Wo else part kiss time par exceute ho raha hai??)
How to print 5 numbers out off 10 numbers which is divisible by 5,and all the 10 numbers are multiples of 5 .
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
Premium content thankyou bro❤️
I have taken 10to70 but when I took 5 in if statement the output is showing only 10
We all have heard of IF + ELSE but this is the first time I came across this usage FOR + BREAK + ELSE<br><br>Every teacher loves to see the development of their students. (I know as I use to be a teacher) <br>I have shown you my development through my comments and I think that is the best way to show my gratitude to you and your team. <br>So, I will not give appreciative comments for each and every video in this playlist, but most importantly I would follow your steps and do what you have asked us to do. (But gave a thumbs up to every video)
What if there are multiple elements divisible by 5 ?<br>Using break will print only one element
Sir ,I have a question<br>Num is divisible by 3 print numbers between 1to 100
We could have also used flag I guess . But I really loved this feature of python .Thanks man for giving this lovely course for free ❤️
Navin Sir! Can we use else while we are implementing while loop.?
a = [5,10,23,56,68,96]<br>for i in a:<br>    if i % 5 == 0:<br>        print(i)<br>        continue<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Not found&quot;)<br><br>My question is why it&#39;s printing &quot; Not found&quot; at the end if we are getting all the values divisible by 5 and if we use break instead of &quot;continue&quot; then it only shows one value only.
Love the way you teach !!!   😎
You could just use return because it will close loop if it returns but it won&#39;t if &#39;if block&#39; didn&#39;t run.
Dear Navin, your videos are really good , i can say learn in Fun way...Great and thank you very much
thanks for the brief and we can also use the break in else, if not found to be printed for once.
Hi Navin, I love your videos!<br>AM new to programming post my engineering. And learning python now at 37 :)
What if we wanna print more than one value from nums. And how to do it?
Thank you so much for this extremely useful set of videos on programming. Great for people trying to learn on their own.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38svC3U7hVo&amp;t=4m20s"">4:20</a> we can put break at end to get not found only once.
you could also use return print(num) instead of break. return stops the loop
You&#39;re a genius !
The way you teach is amazing sir. <br>Step by step <br>Thank you so much 😊
sir else ke print ke baad break nahi laga sakte?
Sir if we are using for else statement then do we have to use if statement to
Thx Navin, it&#39;s an amazing way of teaching. I like it.
So, students will never learn flag variables then, if coming straight to Python instead of other programming languages!
Bro where are assignments how can we learn without assignments
good pt.
Sir you teaching is amazing
Can you please explain the way the code is getting executed step by step, sir?
sir...what if the num list contains two elements divisible by 5?
sir what if we what 2nd value
I am glad that Kurt Angle quit WWE and started teaching coding 😊
how &#39;num&#39; is used?
My code is working completed fine without break . <br>Is that an issue to fix..??🤔🤔
Before watching this episode I was able to cracked how to find a prime number <br>From knowledge of previous episodes Thanks @Navin Reddy Sir<br>Love Your Series Sir..... 😍
Nice mostache sir!
Learning more from this than my two years in college. Thanks Navin &lt;3
Sir, what to do if we want to print all the numbers from nums divisible by 5????
I want to find all the numbers in the list which are divisible by 5. And in this case as you said we dont have to use break. Then if i want to print not found if no numbers in the list are divisible by 5. How do we do?? i want to print not found only 1 time in this case also. <br><br>i am not using break in this case and still if i want to print not found only once, then how do we do. <br>I hope you understood my doubt sir. <br><br>Pls respond, i am not able to find the answer for this in any other videos
sir else: part will execute always in case with for this means u r printing not found intentionally ,so u can print without else part also ! Plz reply to this answer....
why intro got changed here ?
:)
BRO THIS VIDEO SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AFTER FOR LOOP But i dont know why u placed far away from FOR LOOP.
awsome content feeling intresting
What if we want a user generated list and check if any value of the list given by user has a number divisible by 5 but if no number is divisble by 5 it prints (&#39;not found&#39;) but only once..<br>I know telusko will keep quite on this question.
at 4 :56<br>Why does it print &quot;Not found&quot; when we remove &quot;break&quot; statement from the code?<br>why is it even executing &quot;else&quot; statement when the condition of &quot;for&quot; loop is true?<br>And if the &quot;break&quot; statement is being executed because it comes under &quot;if&quot; (check the indentation) then shouldn&#39;t it execute the else statement irrespective of the fact whether we use &quot;break&quot; or not?
plz give name of music of the intro
ooof made it much clear
Great

Thanks for explaining this so clearly!!
If I want print all number which divisible by 5 , and if not divisible that time print Not Found.....what should I do sir?
what if i want to print the last digit from the list...... not the first one
Waade legend
Sir ,<br>if we are having nested if conditions inside for loop <br>then the &quot;for else&quot; refers to which if of for loop??
Sir you are great , only one who teaches concept , you admire us to learn more , thank you very much
Amazing videos..!!  But I have a doubt regarding the for else topic..  In case my list has multiple numbers that are divisible by 5 then how much I suppose to print all those numbers??  Becoz wen I put break it prints only one number that is divisible by 5..
Sir what if the value of NUM is 1 or 2
Sir i don&#39;t have PC <br> how can i practice it<br>Plzz sir help me...
helpful
what if we there are 2 numbers divisible by 5, and we want to print only the 2nd number. (Not the first one)
Hehe.... more than 20 years of python on my back and newer used that.... nice gimmik 😀
sir here is the best compliment for you -&gt;<br>&quot;YOU ARE VIN DIESEL OF IT SECTOR  :)&quot;
amazing video
Best thing videos are short and simple
OK,<br>Your videos are interesting but make them more good and more easy for beginners

This video was so much helpful!<br>Thank You Navin for existing
😐😂😂<br>See I used for else in the previous assignment code u have given 🙆🤦‍♂️<br># Write your code<br>x=int(input())<br>for i in range(2,x):<br>    if(x%i)==0:<br>        print(&quot;not prime&quot;)<br>        break <br>else:<br>    print(&quot;prime&quot;)
For i in range ( 0, telusko&#39;s latest video + 1)<br>             Print(&#39; Love your videos&#39;)
Sir, <br>If there are more than one number which are divisible by 5, we can&#39;t get them in output, if we write a &quot;break&quot; there to get the &quot;for else&quot; feature.<br>In case of a  list of numbers, if there are one or more numbers that match our required criterion and want to print all of them and also use the &quot;else&quot; statement ...in that case how will we write?
Thank you for the indentation..
In the above program I need to print 10 and 15 with using else statement with using break also.
amazing
What if i want to print 15 and 25 both numbers though i use break and else
its really helpful.. I have suggested many of my friends to follow ur viedios... Thanks for sharing ur knowledge with common people...
Assignment?
Hi I have a question for #24 can we use the continue and print all the number num%5 and use <br>for if else ?
Sir you said to print only one value divisible by 5 use break.what if we have to print 2 values which are divisible by 5
Congrats sir , you completed 1 million subscribers ✌️✌️<br>Yeah... Party party 🎈🎈🎉
youre a good and helpful teacher,however i suggest you to explain the answers of your assignments briefly too because some people get stuck there and get demotivated.the answers are in the comment section yes,but for some understanding those can be challenging.Furthermore,i suggest you to give projects with the information gained so far aswell.Ofcoure we are learning the foundation but what to do with that knowledge,fun little games can be a great exercise,for example  creating a personal trivia by using use input,or creating a login page by user input.I send best wishes!"

i want to check 1 so what is the output
I think that this code is inefficient because it can&#39;t tell whether 2 is or not a prime number
for num in range (0, 10):<br>    if num % 2 == 0:<br>        print(num)<br>        continue<br>    print()
I solved it by using list<br><br>Here it is:-<br><br><br>ancientGreece = []<br><br>num = int(input(&quot;type an integer greater than or equal to 100:&quot;))<br><br>for h in range(1 , num+1):<br>    r = h<br>    ancientGreece.append(r)<br><br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23now"">#now</a> it will go in the part of printing prime numbers. <br><br><br><br>for j in range(2, num+ 1):<br>    for p in range(2, num+1):<br>        q = j * p<br>        if q in ancientGreece:<br>            ancientGreece.remove(q)<br><br><br>print(ancientGreece)
Sir if we put 9 in this program.,it will show prime.,but 9 is not a prime numbers.,..
n = int(input(&quot;Enter a number to be check wether it is a prime number or not.\n&quot;))<br>k=0<br>for i in range(2,n): #2 10(n)-1<br>    if n%i==0:<br>        print(n,&quot; is not a prime number.&quot;)<br>        break<br>    else:<br>        k=1<br><br>if k==1:<br>    print(n,&quot; is a prime number.&quot;)
This really helped, I dont get why my python Professor has to overcomplicate these simple maths question by using tens of different functions and identifiers, Thank you again
Efficient way of doing problem:<br><br>import math<br>num = 19<br>end = math.sqrt(num)<br>value = math.floor(end)<br>for i in range(2,value):<br>    if num % i == 0:<br>        print(&#39;Not Prime&#39;)<br>        break<br>else:<br>    print(&#39;Prime&#39;)

2 is a prime number, but your code will return Not prime

welcome back aliens 🤣🤣🤣🤣
we can even write,<br>num=int(input( &#39;enter the number__&#39;))
Thank you sir <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>

the other way is first checking if the number is odd if it is we see if it is divisible by a odd number
Thanks bro
Thank you sir!!🙂

this is the best beginner videos on YouTube
a number can be divisible by itself and 1 for sure but except these it can only be divisible by the numbers ranging from 2 to upto half of that given number. so instead of checking from 2 to n we can check from 2 to n/2.<br><br>def findPrime():<br>    num = int(input(&quot;Enter a number : &quot;))<br><br>    if num == 1:<br>        return print(&quot;Not a Prime number&quot;)<br><br>    for x in range(2, (num // 2) + 1):<br>        if num % x == 0:<br>            print(&quot;Not a Prime number&quot;)<br>            break<br>    else:<br>        print(f&quot;{num} is a prime number&quot;)<br><br><br>findPrime()
The fastest way to find prime numbers is by using &quot;Sieve of Eratosthenes&quot; method.<br>def sieve(n):<br>    prime = [0 for i in range(101)]<br>    for i in range (2,n+1):<br>        if prime[i]==0:<br>            for j in range (i*i,n+1,i):<br>                prime[j]=1<br><br>    for i in range (2, n+1):<br>        if prime[i]==0:<br>            print (i, end =&quot; &quot;)<br><br>num = int(input(&quot;enter the range for prime numbers:  &quot;))<br>sieve(num)
from math import sqrt<br>n = 5<br>for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n) + 1)):<br>    if n % i == 0:<br>        print(n, &quot;is not a prime number&quot;)<br>        break<br>else:<br>    print(n, &quot;is a prime number&quot;)
9 is also comes prime number in the upper code
Efficiency we can check from 2 to num/2, because if any number is not divisible till it&#39;s half number then it&#39;s prime.
x =int(input(&quot;Enter Your Number Please: &quot;))<br>if x == 2:<br>    print(&quot;A Prime Number.&quot;)<br>else:<br>    for i in range(2,x):<br>        if x % i == 0:<br>            print(&quot;Not a Prime Number.&quot;)<br>            break<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;A Prime Number.&quot;)
import math<br><br>n = int(input(&#39;Check a number is prime or not : &#39;))<br>limit = math.floor(math.sqrt(n))<br>print(limit)<br><br>for i in range(2, limit+1):<br>    if n % i == 0:<br>        print(&#39;Not prime&#39;)<br>        break<br>else:<br>    print(&#39;Prime number&#39;)
Your code not working with 15...it say 15 is prime number...and 15 is not prime number
can anyone explain how is this code is working for 2?? as 2%2==0, so why is it not printing &#39;not prime&#39;....
Sir, pls explain on number 2...I&#39;m a beginner and trying t out to handle number 2  on the prime number program. Kindly revert soon

how to check first prime number can you make the video sir
Why we used here (num) instead of (num+1) ?
sir what about 0 and 1..??in this code?
Tq sir nice explain
to have a user input in this program i changed that program into this:<br><br>num = int(input(&#39;Enter an integer to check whether its prime or not! &#39;))<br>for i in range(2, num):<br>    if num % i == 0:<br>        print(&#39;Not a prime number&#39;)<br>        break<br>else:<br>    print(&#39;Its a prime a number&#39;)

Hello sir, I have a question. I want a function where the system can take the value of an index array whose value is more than the data we want. For example, I have an array, and data.<br><br><br><br>Arrays :<br>SumNumber = [30,40,50,60]<br><br><br><br>Data :<br>Value_Data = 40<br><br><br><br>each index of the array has a Value, 0th index = 30, 1st index = 40, 2nd index = 50, 3rd index = 60.<br><br>So, how do you get a value from an index array whose value is greater than Value_Data?<br><br><br><br>Because of the array, whose value is above Value_Data is only the 1st index to the 3rd index. Because the 0th index has a value below 40. Do you know how it works, sir?<br><br><br><br>Thanks

Write a program to find whether 2 arrays are compatible or not. Two arrays are said to be compatible if they are of the same size and if the ith element in the first array is greater than or equal to the ith element in the second array for all the values of i.

Hello sir, I have a question. I want a function where the system can take the value of an index array whose value is more than the data we want. For example, I have an array, and data.<br><br><br><br>Arrays :<br>SumNumber = [30,40,50,60]<br><br><br><br>Data :<br>Value_Data = 40<br><br><br><br>each index of the array has a Value, 0th index = 30, 1st index = 40, 2nd index = 50, 3rd index = 60.<br><br>So, how do you get a value from an index array whose value is greater than Value_Data?<br><br><br><br>Because of the array, whose value is above Value_Data is only the 1st index to the 3rd index. Because the 0th index has a value below 40. Do you know how it works, sir?

Ans No. 2<br>from array import *<br>k = array(&#39;i&#39;,[])<br>arr = array(&#39;i&#39;,[4,5,6,7,8])<br>for i in range(len(arr)-1,-1,-1):<br>       k.append(arr[i])<br>print(k)
Ans no, 1<br>from array import *<br>arr = array(&#39;i&#39;,[4,5,6,7,8])<br>for i in range(len(arr)):<br>    if i == 2:<br>        continue<br>    else:<br>        d= arr[i]<br>        print(d)
I saw so many classes about phython sir,but no chanel is not have clear cut theme sir,but u are very very simplier the concepts sir,tnq sir

your end screen video cards are covering the content WTF?
from array import array<br><br>arr=array(&#39;i&#39;,[])<br>n=int(input(&#39;how many values dawg?&#39;))<br>for i in range(n):<br>    x=int(input(&#39;enter the next value&#39;))<br>    arr.append(x)<br><br>val=int(input(&#39;enter which value to delete&#39;))<br>if val==2:<br>    arr.pop(2)<br>    print(arr)<br><br>else:<br>    print(&#39;nothing to delete&#39;)
2)from array import*<br>arr = array(&#39;i&#39;,[10,20,30,40,50])<br>newArr=array(&#39;i&#39;,[])<br>k=0<br>for i in arr:<br>    k=k-1<br>    newArr.append(arr[k])<br>print(newArr)
Does for loop also need increment and counter parts like while loop?<br>Since we didnt use any these parts in previous questions, hence i am asking.
Hi,<br>Enjoyed the video and found it useful. Just one query - which you may already have addressed in another video - what if the searched-for element isn&#39;t in the array? The program currently stops with an error message. I presume you will at some stage include something like<br>try:<br>    print(arr.index(val))<br>except ValueError:<br>    print(&#39;Not in array.&#39;)<br><br>Thanks
If you give the adds how can we see the assignment Naveen
1)from array import *<br><br>arr = array(&#39;i&#39;,[10,20,30,40,50])<br><br>for i in arr:<br>    if i == arr[2]:<br>        del arr[2]<br><br>print (arr)
Came up with the following for the assignment:<br><br># Those who can not see the assignment due to Playlist in front of questions.. The assignment que. is:<br># 1) Create an array with 5 values &amp; delete the value at index no. 2 without using in-built function.<br># 2) write a code to reverse an array without using in-built function.<br><br>from array import *<br>from math import *<br><br>arr = array(&#39;i&#39;, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])<br><br>print(arr)<br><br>arr2 = array(&#39;i&#39;, [])<br><br>for i in range(len(arr) ):<br>    if i == 2:<br>        continue<br>    arr2.append(arr[i])<br><br>arr = arr2<br><br>print(arr)<br><br>#2 reverse array without inbuilt function<br><br>floor = floor(len(arr) / 2)<br>l = len(arr)<br><br>for i in range(floor):<br>    x = arr[i]<br>    arr[i] = arr[l-i-1]<br>    arr[l-i-1] = x<br><br>print(arr)
sir am form non IT background and by watching your videos feel very comfortable in python. Thanks a lot sir.

Big fan of you Navin sir.
Okay I want to share my story of installing Numpy on my system.  I took me 6 complete hours to figure out how to do it. I hope sharing my experience will save your time.<br>1. I typed &#39; pip  install numpy&#39; in cmd and it showed a warning &#39;you are using pip version 20.2.3, however version 20.2.4 is available&#39;. I installed the newer version but it wasn&#39;t that necessary. <br>2. However I kept gettng a messase everytime i tried installing numpy saying &quot;microsoft visual c++ 14.0 is required.&quot; So what you have to do here you have to install <br>(i) Visual studio 2019 using visual studio installer. Don&#39;t delete the visual studio installer app.<br>(ii) Visual C++ redistributable from the official microsoft website<br>3. Then you have to run the visual studio installer app again to modify the visual studio installed on your machine.Go to workloads and choose &#39;Desktop development with C++&#39;&#39; and tick the &#39;MSVC v142-VS2019 C++....&#39; and &#39;windows 10 SDK&#39; options ( try to tick the recent ones).<br>this installation will take around 30 min.<br>4. Then you restart your machine and type &#39;pip3 install numpy&#39; in cmd. Mine worked after this. Thanks Navin Reddy sir. Without your amazing video I would not have the motivation to overcome the difficulties associated with installing a simple package which will enable me to do  2D -3D array calculations on computer"

Those who want Clarity on logspace()<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The values that are given as input are log(base10) values<br> so if input is 2  the actual value is 10^2=100(^ means power)<br><br>logspace() follows Geometric Progression<br><br>It uses log(base 10) values. In simple Terms<br> <br>Eg :  logspace(2,5,3)<br><br>       here 2 means 10 raised 2 times which is 100 (Prior Knowledge on log is required here)<br><br>        and 5 means 10 raised 5 times  which is 100000<br><br>          In Geometric Progression nth term is a*r^(n-1)  (^ means power<br><br>       here a value is 100<br>         n is 3<br>          last term (nth term)= a*r^(n-1)=100000<br>               <br>               100*r^(3-1)=100000<br>                 100*r^2=100000<br>                   r^2=1000<br>                <br>                  r=10*sqrt(10)=31.622776601683796<br>  <br>                  so the  3 numbers are<br>                 100*(31.622776601683796)^0=100.0 ,<br>                100*(31.622776601683796)^1=3162.2776601683795<br>                100*(31.622776601683796)^2=100000.0<br><br>                 So The 3 numbers are 100.0,3162.2776601683795,100000.0<br><br><br>         Like If You Got Clarity
Those who want Clarity on linspace()<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Linspace has separate stuff hidden in it It is similar to Arithmetic Progression.<br>Eg: linspace(0,7,3) <br>in arithmetic Progression we have nth term or last term is   a+(n-1)*d <br><br>In this case a is 0  and n is 3<br>l=a+(n-1)d=7 <br><br><br>0+(3-1)d=7<br>2d=7<br>d=7/2 =3.5<br>d is common difference between 2 adjacent values<br><br>So the result we get is<br>0.0 ,   3.5 ,    7.0<br>Hope This helps If you are in search of clarity<br><br>Like It If You got Clarity

Sir, how can we create an array dynamically using numpy library?
Sir I didn&#39;t understand linspace and logspace properly ;-;
Difference beween linspace() and logspace():<br><br>Suppose you have a cake, and you ask linspace to cut it into 5 parts, linspace will cut it in five EQUAL parts, But if you ask logspace to cut the cake into 5 parts, it will cut the cake in five UNEQUAL parts. Everyone will get different sizes, just that it will cut in five parts that&#39;s it.
can any one plz help me that why it is givinf int32 but not only int and similarly float64
the linspace and others are similar to the ones in MATLAB
nice one Mr == right sir. can&#39;t stop learning and running  this
sir, can u please explain logsapace() clearly and when we use dtype function it shows int 32 and float 64 but what is the meaning of that numbers?
Sir you teach at Vidyalankar isn&#39;t it ?
sir i have problem with installing numpy . it is not installing lataset version.(no problem)
Can you give us the PDF which will consist of all the concepts,methods to study and a better way to remember and study later<br>Pls consider my question sir pls
Nice video , But this video creates lots of questions like where can we use these functions and whats the use of these functions.
So why we from array import<br>When we can use numpy???
Sir what is the use of numpy
thank you.....its fun learning with you....being cs student i was always afraid of coding...but the way you are teaching really creates interest and enjoy learning.....thankyou so much sir
sir i am not getting answer when i am giving code like this ,after installing numpy also<br><br>from numpy import *<br>arr=array([1,2,3,4])<br>print(arr)<br>output :<br><br> arr=array([1,2,3,4])<br>NameError: name &#39;array&#39; is not defined
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYPKbmE0H6E&amp;t=2m10s"">2:10</a> what is int&quot;32&quot;? and is logspace related to logarithms?
Hi sir,<br>Can we find the series of sinx and the value of sine function at different values of x.
could you explain zeros(),ones(),logspace(),linespace().
Hello sir thank you so much for this tutorial it&#39;s a great help, just one double in this video- can&#39;t understand logspace() , please help

sir my im facing problem with numpy installation in pycharm my idle is has numpy bt my pycharm is showing error for installing of numpy<br>please help me out with it ........my idle is of 32 bits where as pycharm is of 64 and ide is using lattest version of python whereas pycharm is running on 3.7.., so please try to help me out with this and fix this
Sir, while printing array created using logspace as print(&#39;%.2f&#39; %arr[0]), You specified an index of one element. I want to print to the whole array here. Tried different ways as: print(&#39;%.2f&#39; %arr), print(&#39;%.2f&#39; %arr[]) But none works, getting different errors
I tried print(arr.dtype) and says object. yours says int 32
Its giving error when trying to install numpy
Logspace make some doubt
Ur teaching is paranormal to others teaching sir I would like to appreciate ur videos  sir tq....
name &#39;linpsace&#39; is not defined<br>this error has happen what to do?
i got stuck on logspace...maybe I may learn in 11
in arange why 15 didn&#39;t come

sir, I&#39;m not able to do it on vscode,
My numpy is not installing whenever I click on +  it shows error loading package list pypi. Python. Org
Hi, I have newly joined ur classes about python and downloaded the latest version of it, but it&#39;s not working, whenever I m feeding input its says error.  I cant also run the command prompt, IDLE, and the NumPy installation. what to do?
I&#39;m getting an error that says &quot; name &#39;array&#39; is not define&quot;. Can someone explain to me why is that happening?
Hey Navin, I am really enjoying the python lecture by u. I have query. May please tell me in lecture #29, u typed for the type of the array and is saying int32 or float 64, please clarify what is 32 and 64
Sir please explain the logspace() and linspace()
Congrats sir, it reached 1M subscribers 😍😊
You increase my knowledge about python array to a higher level....You are really  a genius
what is the use of these ?
all these r 1-d arrays so do we need numpy in this cases
Sir I  am faceing problem with pycharm .....configuration problem  that no interpreter found I see many videos but I can&#39;t solve ... please suggest me any best  video  for pycharm settings. .please sir.. Thank you in advance...!
sir how to install numpy
I am having a error to add numpy, it says <br>Error: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement numpy<br>Error: No matching distribution found for numpy
sir ur best but this time i had a little trouble in understanding logspace <br>if someone can explain it too me dont fell shy to reply
t-3.19 mins<br>I don&#39;t know the reason why 15 is not printed in the output region.<br>Please explain???
Hello Navin, thank you for the good job that you continue to do. Just a quick one and not related to the above video, how comprehensive is this series? Does it cover all the basics (topics) that I would require to learn on Python? Thanks.
numpy is not working in my pycharm even after installing !!!
any body please clear my <a href=""http://doubt.it/"">doubt.it</a> goes like this &quot;we are creating array like this - &quot;array([564,34,34])&quot;- here we are using box bracket what if if we create array like this &quot;array((564,34,34))&quot;-brackets.whats difference between these two <a href=""http://brackets.is/"">brackets.is</a> it going to take these brackets()-as tuple &quot;

with arr1.view() we are supposed to have different addresses. then why after changing  arr1[1] to 7 both arrays printed same address, even using views.
sir, I have a small doubt what&#39;s the use of shallow copy I mean if both the array will have the same id also it will act as a shallow copy, and moreover, shallow copy copies the whole array so it has O(n) time complexity?

sir do videos on SQL
Thanks! Why do you not need to write np.matrix?
your lectures are so good , iam enjoying the way you teach python.
Any tutorials on how to parse a list of arrays or list of matrices in python? <br><br>I have a list of 10 arrays of 4x4 size and I am generating a random number, this random number I want to see if it is in the first row of any matrix on the list, and if it is there, I want to know wich matrix it is in and start a counter for that matriz saying that it has found a number.
I wanted to understand<br>arr.reverse() <br>print(arr) will give the output                       BUT<br>arr.flatten()<br>print(arr) it will not give the output<br><br>and if i store the result of arr.flatten, then i get the output<br>arr1=arr.flatten()<br>print(arr1)
it&#39;s a great place to learn the technologies
Thank you so much sir. Your videos are really great.

How to add values in 2D array from user input ? ...Because append function is not working in numpy, is there any other function in numpy for this?
help me to solve this error: TypeError: array() argument 1 must be a unicode character, not list
The best part is the way he says &quot;ba-bye&quot; at the end of every video...😅😂
you are indeed an excellent teacher of Python!
is transpose,inverse of matrix also available ??
njoying this video :)

What is the difference between print() and return
I am really  happy with your detail  explanation...Thank You.
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVfCWuca9nw&amp;t=7m35s"">7:35</a>  just shocked cause my name is Rahul 😅
only bad thing about this is that my head literally hurts from his yelling
Thank you very informative
I Receommend for more view , pl dispaly clear and full screesn.. its really not possoble to follow ur content
Thank you!

thank you sir
Sir, thanks for this video because I was having some doubts in function topic, but now all doubts are clear 😊
yaa we enjoy the video thanks so much
When we call a function can we pass the values as variable. Mean in place add(5,6) if I say d=5 and e=6 then add(D, e) will that work? And add(D, 7) like this
That&#39;s a  great work done by you sir it&#39;s helping every one a lot for learning quickly python thank you so much sir 🙏🏻🙏🏻 it&#39;s also like a rivision for me because I learned python earlier but it&#39;s not that clear in my mind like you did now all the concepts and basics I learnt to see your great and very interesting videos thank you so much sir for making videos like this 🙏🏻🙏🏻😊
Thanks for the great explanation!
Sir my code is not executing

Very well explained sir
print(&#39;Sir , we love your emoji you used in this videos , the first revealation of it was surprising as it was a celebration and its good to see something like this in a video &#39;)
The way of your explanation outstanding and in point of view out of the world love you sir from button of my heart 💓 amazing 👌
Your cartoon character was excellent sir😂😂
how return keyword works?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVfCWuca9nw&amp;t=7m34s"">7:34</a> the best explanation I have ever heard to understand types of function
sir great job !!!!! thanks a lot  ...

As I am new to Python programming language. I really like the way of your training. But my friend told me that the code changes for every version of Python. Is it okay to learn the content you have given in these videos because it is uploaded before 4 years?
If i watch it....10 times i wont understand...i knew english. And concepts of python before this...but this didn&#39;t get....ufff!!!...
All good but  pleace change the background please convert it into black it hurts, genuine comment from my side
in your 7-15 mins video there is lot of matter to undrestand

Sir ,as a beginner i&#39;m not able to understand only this video , plz do something about it<br>Btw love your series
First time I did not understand well😣😣🥺
mutable variables (integers and strings): passed by value, new memory location created<br>immutable variables (lists): passed by reference, original variable updated at the same location
After watching 5 to 6 times I finally understand it 🙏
i could not catch this concept much how were the values affected and changed
Amazing video.. only hope those who watched understood what is being talked about!! God save the Gen Z or whatever if this is how concepts are taught! Thanks Brandon Lim  for his comments below for clarity.
ive given up hope already
Please add a video for this. This concept was a bit confusing.
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
Sir,<br>In the scenario of list, original values got changed, should we create a copy of the list in the function always in order to prevent overriding or original values ?
# def fun(i,a):<br>#     print(id(a))<br>#     if i&gt;=len(a)//2:<br>#         return<br>#     fun(i+1, a+[&quot;a&quot;]) <br>#     print(i,a)<br>    <br>def fun(i,a):<br>    print(id(a))<br>    if i&gt;=len(a)//2:<br>        return<br>    a.append(&quot;a&quot;)<br>    print(id(a))<br>    fun(i+1, a)<br>    print(i,a)<br><br>a=[1,2,3]<br>print(id(a))<br>fun(0,a)<br><br>i think this example might be helpful
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijXMGpoMkhQ&amp;t=5m13s"">5:13</a> time was <a href=""http://amazing.lol/"">amazing.LOL</a>
Dude, you speak like a bullet train...
Thank you  Navin Sir, i have gone through many sites but your tutorial is really outstanding....
Thank you so much for making this video i was breaking my head over this as in case of immutable variables everytime  a change happens python will create a new memory but for mutable variables it uses the same memory so if see the list before and after the calling the function both will have the same value.
Really solved my confusion, a new python learner
please not so fast. explain slowly.
Lots of love and respect sir !❤
for the first I did not understand
Pass by value: We pass the copy value of the object and changing the copy of object will not change the original object.<br><br>Pass by reference: We pass a reference or memory to the function and changing the object in the function will ultimately change the original object as they both reference to the same memory location.<br><br>However in python,<br>Concept of pass by value or pass by reference is dependent entirely on the mutability of the object passed to the function.<br><br>If the passed object is immutable like a number or string. i.e changing them would create entirely new object. Passing by value comes to play.<br><br>However in case of mutable objects like lists. Changing the value will cause it to change the original object directly. This feature portrays the pass by reference.
Cause these videos are three years old.
Are you still available to make me understand in more simple way.
Sir, I&#39;ve seen 32lectures before this, but I m totally confused with this one.
sir this was not clear sir...let you give another explanation about this topic sir...
The way you teach.. really amazing.. Thank you sir
Completely defeats the point I&#39;m lookin for. How to pass data into the function.  Nobody  needs to know the values are sharing a memory space.
hello sir<br>A big thanks for ur videos which are really helping me a lot can u please share me the notebook for all the videos merge,i need not book if u have that possibly try to send me which indeed helpful further my internship, as well as my placement kindly, share it as soon as possible to my email id
Hi Navin, though I love most other videos for python and would recommend others to learn from you. But am so sorry to let you know that I did not understand anything in this video tutorial. Thanks anyway. Keep sharing, keep growing
Sir, if the value of a is updated by function but then why value of a is printed as 10...and if the parameter(a)  that is taken by the function is not the parameter which we have assigned value 10,then why the ID of a is same as the parameter(a)  passed through the function..
what i understood is  int and string are immutable, there value is passed only in defined function and not to the whole following code.<br>while list and dictionary pass the updated value to the following code out of user defined function
This is confusing!
for the 1st time, could not understand the lecture at all sir....
Confused
def foo(x):<br>    x = [&#39;def&#39;, &#39;abc&#39;]<br>    return id(x)<br>q = [&#39;abc&#39;, &#39;def&#39;]<br>print(id(q) == foo(q))<br><br>why is this false ? list is mutable.
Till now every video is  clear but this video is confusing
☹
I dont know coding intially. so im like &#39;Hey,, PYTHON is so easy&#39; ,,untill this video....
The simple concept is integers are immutable so we can&#39;t change or update orginal value(the value stored before update).List is mutable so we can update the original value
Sadly,  your explanation wasn’t clear nor concise<br><br>I wasn&#39;t able to understand this particular video but other videos seem to be fine so far
if you make an another video over this topic then please share the link
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijXMGpoMkhQ&amp;t=4m42s"">4:42</a> lmao
but,  what if i want to pass a mutable object into a function, than store the output of the function in a variable and than I need to reuse the initial value of the mutable object but i can not because it&#39;s been changed?<br>how can i get around that?
you rushed...
Im sorry, this is confusing and hard to follow..
Not understood this video
4 8 13 lines are same y writing many times
worst video in the playlist not a single concept is clear
This series is very much helpful for students like me, who is switching from Java to Python. Thanks Navin sir.😀
this video was totally above my head....u totally confused me 😵😵
I m not able to understand... What was that??
Sir can you please explain this concept briefly...... i am unable to catch the concept
Sir can u explain why u mentioned that integer and Strings are immutable ?
too complicated .....
in filmy fantasy...<br>value = body clone<br>reference = aatma(soul)<br><br>so <br>pass by value is pass  clone<br>pass by reference = pass  aatma<br><br>in python we dont have anything..<br>it depends on what the animal is..if its immutable(non changeable) like cow,dog,yak..they cant change themselves hence if you want to create a new yak with one horn then god will create new yak and not update the exsiting species..<br><br>if animal is mutable...like humans..girls and boys..they can change ..they can makeup and change the gender looks..<br><br>lol..i dont know it is helps someone
def up(x):<br>    x = 9<br>    print(&quot;x &quot;,x)<br>    <br>up(4).................<br>What is the use of passing this &quot;4&quot;?????
not a clear definition ji
cant understand bro
I am confused . I really didn’t understand this video if someone can help me
Following your python series this was the first lecture vedio that i couldn&#39;t understand
Wonderfully explained
The best video . got all my doubts about arguments in functions in python . and in just 8 minutes .!
He is the exact senior developer, we see in the memes.....<br>Thank you navin ✌️
worst video in terms of clarity in this course.
bro telugu lo chayachuga bro
oh god!!!  as the array comes, i started watching every video the second time .
@Navin sir, can u please explain this concept in a new video, slightly confused here
If you give with any practical example that would be more helpful. I have price of commodities, after few days the price has change  on review I need to see both prices how to do that?
Not understanding this video can you brief it in more detail
Thank you !!
Rubbish tbh... not explaining the concept...
Not getting concept clear

Good sir first of all u all should read about pass by value and pass by reference and then u should watch this video i m sure u will get the all stuff 👍☺️☺️☺️
Confusing sir
Yeah enjoy 👍
IMHO, its easier to think that integers and strings are passed by value while lists are passed by reference.
Sir I didn&#39;t undestood properly
This is little bit confusing can u make it more clear pass by Val --- pass by ref
In my very honest opinion, belonging to a non-IT field (and also Python being the first language I am learning, and this playlist being my first source for it), I think you are losing the touch from the last video sir. This series of videos started off great, but I am not able to understand and grasp some things now. Please focus more on clearing the concepts rather than your fluency or other things. A big thank you for all the videos until now. You are the reason I got hooked to Python, but please clarify better. Thanks.
I feel not clear... 😕☹️🙄
Dude u r confusing 🤦🏻‍♂️
sorry sir i cant understand this.can u please add another video for this concept
your code is not working for me
sir,I can&#39;t able to understand this concept
Sir i am not able to understand this concept. Big fan of yours
Thank you sooooo much bro for the tutorial this is very Understandable and useful 😇
God better best
@2.00 ,technically 10 should b printed ,why it does print 8..nt gettin it
Sir, <br>I cannot understand why the output of both the prints is same even though we are changing the element 1 in list in update(list) . Please kindly reply my comment
I&#39;m Immensly Addicted to ur teaching videos sir thank for teaching us.....
Can u explain this concept again...
bakwassss
Thank you!
ALMOST AT 1M
Sir we need a separate video on pass by value and pass by reference, as we didn&#39;t understood the concept ."

Great....
navin ka bada ha 1.
Thanks so much 🙏
Can we add int and strings by this
Actually variable length argument is confusing me please explain it again 🙏🙏..
why can&#39;t we use d=sum(b) and then add it with a?
Love you sir
What is the difference between parameter and argument sir..... Coming to u r vadio 👌👌sir...
He is a real teacher as well as a coder...he could have just deleted the scenes where he got errors, but he kept them to show us that, what type of problems we can get.
good pt.
I am your new subscriber
Go to w3resources to find more practice problems on subtopics atb   ;)
Hai sir I need a help from you  in python <br> I am a beginner in python  i got my first assignment <br>but when i am doing  my programming  it always shows some error  <br>can you help me sir ?
Why we are using c=a in variable length concept line 4? what is the purpose of using that?
Superb sir
Instead of for loop <br>Can I use <br> c=a+Sum(b)
if i want to multiply instead of adding what to do sir???
Navin you don&#39;t check the comments which has doubts u just check those which has some compliment for u why is it like that ? now plz dont ignore my comment
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eci9iU_s6Ag&amp;t=7m40s"">7:40</a>
sir varible length is too big can u make another video for that
How there is print while it is a program of add 5, 6, 34,78 how?? Don&#39;t mind, there&#39;s someone to help me. Mm
def add(x, *y):<br>    a=sum(y)+x<br>    print(a)<br>add(2,3,4,5)
You are a hero teacher for developers
The best man ever ! You&#39;re really a genius
Ur explanation rocks👍👍... thanks navin🙏🙏
doubt <br><br>for i in b:<br>          i++<br><br><br>why the i took the argument values why not index values of tuple?
thank u so much
You are the best Sir 🙏🙏
Superrb explanation 👍👍
Very nice tutorial, please make tutorial on Pandas...
I like the arguments in Monty Python better
What is 123 the result of?
Hello There,<br>I have a question and that is<br>Like we predefined the data-type of argument accept by a Function in C/C++. Can we do so in python?
Thank you, it helped a lot!
Thank you,  this really cleared up a lot of things for me.
Man your videos are great. Jesus bless and save you man!!
Instead of using for loop , we can simply use sum() function<br><br>def add(*args):<br>     print(sum(args))<br><br>add(1,2,3,4,5)
Can we pass a default argument before a non-default argument in the formal arguments?
If we want to enter values at runtime.. Then how can we define either formal or actual arguments??
we can also do<br><br><br> def add(*a):<br>    print(a)<br>    c=0<br>    for i in a:<br>        c=c+i<br>    print(c)<br><br><br>In variable length argument

Sir could you do a tutorial for c++ please 🙏
why were there no assignment problems at the end of the video....we miss it
Which app or software do you use for editing 🙄🙄
Thanks for this valuable instructive video!
I was thinking what we pass is parameter. And the name of the variables we use in the function body is argument.
Variable length a another video needed brother
never understood a single thing about  functions from my school teacher in about 3 monthd but here  in just one go i am crystal clear
-5 editorial was hillarious
age with -5 in that , hahahaahha
Very clear video. Nice production.
very nice explanation.

How do I donate?
We are aliens lol 😂
sir how would we take input from user for this ? please solve it
Sir i am from pakistan, i have paid on udemy ,but i learn python from your channel
can you explain the different frameworks used in python like tinketer
Amazing videos
We can also write like this sir<br>def sum (a, b=[6,7,8]):<br>       c = a+ b[0]+b[1]+b[2]<br>       print (c)<br>sum (a=5)<br><br><br>O/p:<br>26

Hello Navin , what if i have 3 parameters . then also it is same way we need to do  ?
Really awesome teaching sir.... <br>But I think position argument should have explained in detail with another example."

sir 28 ki umar mei bal kaise jhar gaye?
Does the location of defining function matters? when i call the function before the function definition am getting error. And when i call the function after the function definition then its working right.
great content , enjoying a lot
Age=28, city=Mumbai is in I,j then what about mob
After watching several videos on this, I have to say yours is the one that enabled me to understand. Thank you!
Thanks for the video ❣
why do we need j?
brilliant tutorial thank you
Hello sir..I just started to  learn python.from where I can start your vedios
telusko = malum karlo
Fantastic. Very Helpful. Thanks a lot
Man I really love your videos, but please speak little bit slowly! Thank you though 🙂
super sir
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
thanks, it was quick and effective
** means are we passing a dictionary instead of tuple ?????
With * you get a tuple as the output so if the user input comes with a keyword it will give an error. <br>but with ** you get a dictionary as the output, so if the user input comes without a keyword it will give an error.<br><br>WOW, this is the first time we came across using a for loop to a dictionary.<br>Thank you, Navin, for all your great service.
i will complete these playlist soon i will be consistent now and practise daily
someone pls explain <br>what does it mean <br>    .items()    <br>function <br>plsssss<br>I can&#39;t get it

I appreciate your work.. &amp; you&#39;ve a new subs.
You made me love python✌🏻

you are awesome.
didn&#39;t understand **kwargs till i saw this video. <br>Thank you very much Sir.<br>why the light theme tho?
Parameter and Argument are not the same in any way. Parameters is the placeholder like &quot;def sum(a, b)&quot; where as arguments are real value passed like &quot;sum(4, 2)&quot;. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong
sir please provide us the Questions for this concept
I&#39;m not getting bored because of your excellent explanation 😉
I&#39;m very grateful that I&#39;m learning from you sir!

You are really awesome bro, keep like this ❤Nice explained your videos.
helps me a lot in learning python....
Thanks
When I ran this code in my py Android it is showing an error. AttributeError: &#39;dict&#39; object hai no attribute &#39;item&#39; . What shall I do now?
Can you please use dark mode that would be really helpful
Clear and crisp explanation.
A lovely explanation.... just one doubt.. in for loop, why did you used i and j ?
How to do this code using while loop???
Thank you very much for this video :) It was very clear and the explanation behind the use was also very helpful as well! Really helps to see how kwargs can be used to take in optional arguments :)
Thank you Sir!
nice tutorial sir
awesome awesome awesome
Thank you!
Sir, what if we wanted to have a variable length arguments and like we dont have that values.<br>Suppose we have person function with name and data, where in data is the var argument. If we dont have any data for a person we will not pass that right. So for this case what can we do tonget rid of error
tq
Can you please turn the subtitle of this video on? It will be more understandable
this is best video for **kwargs easy to understand . I searched many videos on this topic but not getting concept properly.
is your phone number correct sir?
Thanks a lot for making so simple for understanding the arg and kwarg concept.
hey,, in 4.24(video_timestamp) ,,, in this program if i use your age=028 and mob=09865432 and then i run the program and it will get an error... why???
*data -&gt; takes arguments in tuple fom<br>**data -&gt; takes arguments in dictionary (map) form.
IF the number of Navin reddy of 7 digits is true then we may find his number <br>1) Through permutation and combination<br>2) Remaining 3 numbers would requires <br>3) 1000 combination
sir, u make it very simple in a such short video...great and keep it up!
can we use input in this asking the user to enter the data
I now identify as an alien. <br>Thank you.
Thank you. this was breif, clear and to the point. Christ i wasted so much time listening to other tutorials that never gave me any straight answers
You are a great teacher
could you elaborate on curve fitting for a combination of the line function and gaussian function. Could you tell us as to how to eradicate the errors and uncertainties and come up with proper initial guesses?
Thanks Navin
Thanks for teaching sir.
how is data kwargs ?
thank you sir ,,, stay blessed
You are such a great teacher. I salute u sir.
Damnn...! I am not enjoying it but , I&#39;m loving it more than Mc&#39;Donald&#39;s food...
What is the use of items function
impressive Navin, rather Sir, Navin: respect
**kwargs
OH MY GOSH FINALLY. A tutorial that creates an actual example. Everyone and their dog uses generic BS, creating *args and *kwargs NAMED *args and *kwargs and producing the 90th &#39;foo&#39; argument I&#39;ve seen today. -<i>- This is the first tutorial in a big pile of them that actually made any attempt at an _application</i> of this structure. You&#39;re a hero, sir. Thank you.
ur voice is comical...when listened at 2x speed...😄
Thanks for your vid! You make it as simple as you can to make beginners like me understand how to code with python!
Make series videos on turtle and thinkher
This is not possible in C or java. Thank you for the great video!
why we are using items() here anyone please tell<br>thank you
Hello sir <br>I ran into one little problem which is I wrote exactly your code but my pycharm in line 8 and 9 of your program exactly tells me that I have these errors:<br>unexpected indent(just before the for loop)<br>Statement expected, found Py:DEDENT(just after the print)<br><br>btw thanks for your great tutorials!
Thanks
I have a question to u that is u have made 74 lectures have u made the full python learning after working on all those will we become python expert kikndly reply I am waiting
Finally found a video that explains kwargs in an understandable way! Thank you!
the way you are explaing will goes directly into the brains  of  the people<br>and also into the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23heart"">#HEART</a>@me  sorry ...............<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hearts"">#HEARTS</a>
I&#39;m appreciate ur pedagogical teaching sir we learn a lot.... 🤝🤝
While calling the function is the tuple data  updating itself to Dictionary variable ?
Way better than regular class lectures, finally loving Python<br>thanks
if we want to print height of person what should we do for ex 5&#39;10 is height.., but in print &#39; this will not work
IS ITEM() IS A uder defined or system defined anna
is this correct as I am using the function <br><br>def person(name,**data):<br>    print(name)<br>    for i,j in data.items():<br>        print(i,j)<br><br>x = input(&quot;enter the name : &quot;)<br>y = int(input(&quot;enter the age : &quot;))<br>z = input(&quot;Enter the city : &quot;)<br><br>person(x,age=y,city=z)
Sir can we use dictionary for keyworded variables ??
Awesome teacher and best explanations for novices !!
Can you explain about the function &#39;items&#39; in this program.
good one Mr Navin, but have one prayer. How can one use while loop, in the part u used for loop near the end of the video.
Thank you for clearing concepts sir!
Will we able to pass multiple actual parameters by getting input from the user..?
No doubt that your videos are awesome sir.<br>But can anyone please tell me how **data is considered as dictionary and *data as tuple in last video?
use kwargs when you used key value pair ie. dict other args as tuple
Sir can u explain y we are using the functions items in data
Sir really u teach very simply nd in very interesting way ,I like it .Thank you soo much sir 😊
Normal Human : Mumbai is a Great Place!<br><b>Programmers</b> : Mumbai is a State

Great videos. Learning lots. However the topic of global vs local was challenging to follow especially the globals().
nice video
Offo man. You are nice guy and concept are cleared in 10 min. god bless you man. I am big fan of your way of teaching.
This 10 min video &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2-3 hours of college lecture<br><br>Thank you so much sir ❤
i’ve seen a quite a few videos on variable scope, not one of them mentioned globals(). Thank you for one more useful lesson!
I think the global variables are handled in a matured fashion in C, C++ and Java. I feel Python left a room for confusion.<br>Or maybe I am costumed to those languages.
Sir global variable is getting printed before local variable in my code.
Was a bit heavy but understood. Can we get an explanation in depth on this?
thank you so much sir !!!!!
thanks for the video
what does that <br><br>something() do?
this playlist is heaven thanku so much sir.
very straight point
wow you explaine it to me like i am 2 years ild  (^.^) thank you
thank you so much🙏
Navin Sir...U r Ultimate...the concepts are crystal clear within seconds...Every sec is worth watchin .... U r Truly a gem🔷..Thank u so much for the series..
Please use dark mode next time. Please its a humble request
very good
Can we access a local variable of one function in another function?
You solved a great problem for me, thanku you so much
you&#39;re so cool i love your videos man!
Awesome man, I was stuck for 1 hour on that, tyvm
I want a diploma that says Telusko Academy lol))
thank you sir
Why youtube was not there during my college days. Life would have been so easy. <br>And I must say, you are a very good teacher. I wish you get some cards on Sep 5th every year.
Hi there! Thanks for the help. The issue that I was having was that I was attempting to use the global keyword inside a &quot;While&quot; statement, rather than defining a function and putting it there.<br><br>I was trying to modify the user&#39;s balance based on if they withdraw, and when they made another transaction, it showed the original balance. I was able to make a function where I stated that the balance is global, and right after that set the new balance. Inserting this function into the code works.
What about strings?
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
I think global keyword in python is similar to this keyword in java
Nicely Explained. Can global be declared outside a function.
YOU ARE AMAZING
This helps me a lot , Thankyou🌻
is this logic applicable to lists (which are mutable), also ?
Everything is okay sir but please go slow . because  your speed is too fast. but content is good easy to understand .also simple  English .thank you sir  I  subscribed also  I sended to all of my friends
Can we pass local variable value to Global variable Value.. global variable value initially pointing to None and I wants to assign local value to Global..
讲得非常好
Sir you are an outstanding teacher<br>Hard to find people like you who provide help to the students , that too free of cost<br>Very appreciable<br>Thanks once again
Very helpful, thank you so much
I don&#39;t know how this man is able to explain the topics so beautifully
These 8 minutes tought me 40 minutes of lecture.. Hats Off To You Sir!
Sir, we have taken a before x = globals()[&#39;a&#39;], it is not working when I specified a after writing x = globals()[&#39;a&#39;]. Please help me solve this out.
all in one
Thank you for the great explanation.🙏😀
I love ur explanation<br>Sum=0<br>def add():<br>Sum=sum+1<br>print(sum)<br>add()<br>What will be sum value in add function does it take global varibale<br>add()
ty so much
Explained  wonderfully!!!<br>After watching your video once, When I tried to write code for  this , I got some doubts and then I watched  your video again , Where you have neatly explained / answered all my doubts already. Thank u so much for your videos !!
why we can&#39;t assign boolean as a global variable?
how much more indian can u get
Thanks a lot for the video! Excellent explanation:)
Thanks for getting me understanding this hectic
Thanks for this
How do you initialize a global variable within a function?
One thing to note:<br>globals() cannot be used to call all the global variables at once or even more than one variables at once, expecting a list or a tuple. Will generate an error
Sir your tuturioals are the best their very precise to the point, so not even a second of your lecture is not important and also its very helpful how make these videos and teach us in a very simple manner
vera level sire......pakka teaching.....
Saluteb bro
I was so happy to understand this topic. Thank you so much for helping me learning python &lt;333
Can we use local variable globally?
Sir, usually where we use this concept?
this topic might confuse me
I was reading automate the boring stuff and got stuck on this topic. Thanks, your video is really helpful.
Probably the best i saw to understand this concept! thanks!
def myfunc():<br>    global x<br>    x = 11<br>print(x)<br><br>x is not defined. Why?  This is a global variable.
Awesome Awesome Aweosme
I&#39;m having issues doing this inside another .py file that I&#39;ve imported
Great thanks!
The &#39;this&#39; keyword in Java is represented by the &#39;global&#39; keyword and &#39;global&#39;s()&#39; function in Python, right? Both these keywords are used to resolve the namespace collision in the respective programming languages. Am I right?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYUbLevwgDQ&amp;t=5m25s"">5:25</a>
u teach python well than udemy
its more straight and on the point
What is your editing program dear Navin
Thankyou sir...the local &amp; global variable concept now seems more easier
YOU ARE DOING A COMMENDABLE JOB SIR👏👏
Love the enthusiasm and info.
Heard this from multiple people, understood for the first time, thanks a lot
good
👨‍💻😭 lost me somewhere in between.
2,00,000 people got to learn something from this video. but why did only 8000 hit the like button? that&#39;s really sad
What could we do after watching all your videos
This man has balls using a light theme 😂
I appreciate your  clear concept of teaching ❤️👌
sir please give some assignments also .... i know it is late but please make a seperate video with challenging assignments on python concepts based upon the videos .... please sir !!!
Sir, Then can we mention that the global variable must be specified to execute it inside our specified function???<br>please help me out sir !!
what a skill to teach the programming. As you said in the first video learn how to programming in fun way. hats off
cant we describe another variable why are working on the same and confuse with the &quot;global&quot; stuff(and please tell where we use this keyword in projects)
Sir ur explanation is perfect 👍
Awesome!
thank you brother, very helpful , god bless you
ggggrrrreeeeeaaatttt sirrrr  ...love you
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYUbLevwgDQ&amp;t=5m11s"">5:11</a>- sir you said we cannot have global and local in the same function,but i think its possible with below code without using globals()<br><br>a=10<br>def func():<br>    global a<br>    a=9<br>    print(a)<br>    a=15<br>func()<br>print(a)
How can we modify multiple Global variables using Globals() inside a function. For example: if we have variable a and b outside the function and inside the function I want to change the value of a and b. Can we do that with single statement or I have to use Globals()[&#39;a&#39;]=somevalue and lobals()[&#39;b&#39;]=somevalue?
# Local Vs Global<br><br># Global<br>a=10<br>def something():<br>    # Local<br>    a=15 <br>    print(&quot;in fun&quot;,a)<br>something()<br><br>print(&quot;outside fun&quot;,a)<br><br># if we don&#39;t specify local variable and print a inside the func it will access the global variable a<br><br># Global<br>a=10<br>def something():<br>    print(&quot;in fun&quot;,a)<br>something()<br><br>print(&quot;outside fun&quot;,a)<br><br># in order make the local variable a as global it is possible , once if we change as global <br><br>a=10<br>print(id(a))<br>def something():<br>    global a <br>    a=15<br>    print(id(a))<br>    print(&quot;in fun&quot;,a)<br>something()<br><br>print(&quot;outside fun&quot;,a)<br><br><br><br><br># we want a local variable a and change the global variable a so in that case we can&#39;t use the keyword global to achieve that.<br># want to change the global variable without affecting local variable then:<br><br>a=10<br>print(id(a))<br>def something():<br>    a=15<br>    globals()[&#39;a&#39;]=40<br>    print(id(a))<br>    print(&quot;in fun&quot;,a)<br>something()<br><br>print(&quot;outside fun&quot;,a)
Sir thanks for making such videos ur teaching is very nice but while teaching ur rush and fast plz talk some  slowly
Sir ,you are making an extraordinary effort by bringing up such a nice video on python on free of cost !!, even paid video would become fail in front of your efforts!!
we can define local var in upper line of global a it will work
Thank you!!
Couldn&#39;t have explained it any better 👏.  Thanks
let&#39;s just be clear, you&#39;re awesome
sir what does .item do

great video!
thanks a lot for this video, Kudos to you  for your initiative,  I am beginning to learn. Have a question - When i tried to use even and odd (summation within if) ,it gives zeroes. is there a reason why it is doing like that. I had to use even=even+1, odd=odd+1 to get the results.<br><br>please let me know, thanks again <br>🙂
Thanks!

If we add a float to the list, it doesn&#39;t give you an error, you can run the code.<br>if the decimal value is 0 eg - 2.0 or 3.0 it will run the operation and count either as an even or odd number. <br>But if the decimal value is not 0 eg - 2.1 or 2.2 it will count as an odd number. <br>You can copy the following code, do the changes to the list &quot;lst1&quot; and see it for yourself.<br><br>def count(lst):<br>    even = 0<br>    odd = 0<br>    for i in lst:<br>        if i %2 == 0:<br>            even += 1<br>        else:<br>            odd += 1<br>    return even, odd<br><br>lst1 = [1, 2, 2.1, 2.0, 2.2]<br><br>even, odd = count(lst1)

Here is a bit of elaborate but beautiful code to generate the Fibonacci sequence. This code, will not generate a sequence with any value greater than 100,.

Why do I get 1 after performing as below?<br><br><br>def fact(n):<br><br>    f=1<br><br>    for i in range(1,n+1):<br>        f=f*1<br>    return f<br><br>x = 4<br><br>result = fact(x)<br><br>print(result)
I have an even better teacher then you. Still I m bad, as of now at least
Broo what is I value
Another way:<br>def func(x):<br>    if x==1:<br>        return 1<br>    else:<br>        return x * func(x-1)<br>print(func(5))
Thankyou
Import math<br>Print(math.factorial(4))
This programming example is well thought out and kinda refreshing! It helps me to get back to tutorial again!. thanks for your selfless act.
AGH almost half way through this playlist!
Why (n+1)used clarify sir , f=1 taken why not taken y=0
Alternative code: easy to understand:<br>def fact(n):<br>    f=1<br>    for i in range(1, n+1):<br>        f=f*i<br>    print(f)<br>fact(int(input(&#39;Enter the value to find factorial: &#39;)))
Awesome 👍
its complicated
I had a doubt that why 1 is not getting multiplied by the range, how d process is taking place,i watched this video and then i got it, that when f=f*1,f=1 and so on  when f=f*5 the value of f became 24  and 24*5=120, idk why i had this silly dbt but thank u sir to make it clear to me and i hope if anybody is there like me who had this dbt then it is clear now😊

Step by step pure technical description.
We use recurtion
If we give f =1 inside the for loop then where is the problem sir ..pls tell?

HOW TO FIND THE SAME FOR NEGATIVE NUMBERS
😂😂 literally u might had been in acting...
if wanted to take input from user use below code:

when  use return keyword while using function???? i am very confused help me sir.
Sir ur teaching is awesome but little bit decrease the speed of teaching
Import math<br>math.factorial(5)<br>That&#39;s all let&#39;s do it🚶
find the 100th febonnaci number:
def fact(n):<br>     f=1<br>     while n!=1:<br>          f=f*n<br>          n-=1<br>     return f<br>n=int(input(&quot;enter the last value&quot;))<br>result=fact(n)<br>print(result)
Can I use print(f) instead of return f
n=int(input(&quot;enter the number: &quot;))<br>def fib(n):<br>    a=0<br>    b=1<br>    if n&lt;=1 or n==0:<br>        print(&quot;enter correct number&quot;)<br>    else:<br>          if n==1:<br>            print(a)<br>          else:<br>            print(a)<br>            print(b)<br>            for i in range(2,n):<br>             c=a+b<br>             print(c)<br>             a=b<br>             b=c<br>fib(n)
Bhak, just waste of time
Can i write it as follows -<br>num = int(input(&quot;Enter the number&quot;))<br>for i in range(num) :<br>      f = f*(i+1)<br>Print(f)
Another awesome video! I also watched the one that accomplishes this by recursion. Howeverm in this particular video, I would suggest to include the conditions to take care of negative integers, 0 and 1 as the argument values.
for i in range(2, n+1)<br>This would also work,, multiplying an number with 1 is useless...

Sir, i am getting output as 1.

I love Telusco and Navin
Thnks Telusko ,i just impressed my girl with ur video !!
Recursion limit is 2000 ...but output is 1996 ...why
thanks
how did i miss this channal till now this comment is late but navin bro you did a great job 💥
Hear me out now, <br>Navin is sus
it cant print more than 3000
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkL3SUioNvo&amp;t=4m17s"">4:17</a> why we have to use global to access I because it is already global since I is assigned value outside the function...I really don&#39;t expect error there..why u didn&#39;t mentioned about this situation in Ur global keyword lecture😶😶🙏
Deep knowledge indeed! Thanks!
MAY BE SHORT And SWEET IS LIKE THIS❤️
Answer will be error how it&#39;s coming
Seriously just the most helpful tutorials ever. In 40 videos you have passed the knowledge depth that I&#39;ve seen taught in two introductory state university courses for computer science.
For me recursion is very effective and comes in handy when working with numbers. I have just received an assignment to print directories and their subdirectories by creating a function which recursively calls itself, this is not as simple as using the os.walk method, still wondering how I can make it make sense...
hey i just wanna say that GOD loved the world so much he sent his only begotten<br>son Jesus to die a brutal death for us so that we can have eternal life <br>and we can all accept this amazing gift this by simply believing in him (Jesus) asking for the forgiveness of your sins<br>and forming a relationship with your heavenly father

Thank you very much. You are a genius.
So... Basically is a loop but only using functions? Pretty cool
Sir, you look like Dr. Nitin Kumar Singh   NASA-JPL Caltech, who is scientist at JET PROPULSION LABORATY............ 😊
Accent killing em
You did not need global to access i<br> though
Unlimited Times
im having problem with this for 2 hours thank you very much rofl
while i set the recursion limit to 2000 with the above code i get hello 983 to hello 1993, why does this happen? Does this mean that i don&#39;t get 2000 values?<br>Please help
Sir Navin this video is awesome, I am just learning for the first time that you can increase the recursion limit of a function to be greater than 1000. Thankyou very much I really appreciate.
999999999 is the max limit of setrecursionlimit<br><br><br>😐
Nice teaching sir
I was curious why this version of the code doesn&#39;t print out the numeric values beside the hello, and only prints out 1.<br><br>def greet():<br>    i=0<br>    i+=1<br>    print(&quot;hello&quot;,i)<br>    greet()<br>greet()<br>does it matter if the i=0 is outside the define, or can we call it in the define function?<br>thank you
Best explanation of how to use recursion.
Thanks
very nice lectures u made python lucid
did for 5000 came only till 2595
my man explained recursion so easily thank you so much
Without again mention global variable in local block, can&#39;t we use??
Thank you! You&#39;re the only person I&#39;ve seen explain this in easy to understand terms!
Man I hate recursion so much 😭 it’s kinda hard to understand
Welcome back, Aliens
At 1,000,000 Recursions the program it just die
Why do we need global keyword as global variable can access by the function then why?
your videos have been helpful in my college examinations, thanks
After reading all the comments, I feel so dumb that I can&#39;t understand anything😥
I am getting a hard time in understanding recursion. Can you tell me how should I think while using recursion? It will be very helpful
Thanks, you are great solved my problem<br>Thanks alot

Str=&quot;your videos are unbelievable &quot;<br>Print(str*infinite)
its pronounced python Mr. , not PYTH-ONN
Tried with the value as follows: <br><br><b>sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)</b><br><br>The last value printed was:<br><br><b>Hello 2416</b>
It was i =0 then how it&#39;s printing from hello 1 while it was about to start from hello 0 according to i= 0 , can somebody help??
In subtitles, your name shows &#39;Revenge Ready&#39; . I don&#39;t know why😆.<br>But your tutorials are damn sooo goood
This was a horrible explanation of recursion. Taught more about how to reset a recursion limit. Nothing about base cases or the such.
Infinitely awesome videos
I watched every advertisement on your tutorials as a way of saying thanks for teaching us! You&#39;re my favourite Python sensei! (=
it not increase from 2464. if we put any number bigger than that , recursion is happening only to 2464.
Thanks!
limit for recursion without import sys.setrecursionlimit , just set value of &#39;a&#39; as your limit<br>a = 10<br><br>def function():<br>    global a<br>    <br>    if a == 0:<br>        print(&quot;out&quot;)<br>    else:<br>        a -= 1<br>        print(&quot;recursion&quot;,a)<br>        function()<br><br><br>function()
The limit do not exceeds 2462
if the recursion limit is 2000 then why it is printing 1996 times?
this is the first video i am actually watching of your channel and i loved it so i subscribed.
thanks so much
nice video
Thank you so much sir ..🔥
Why is the function not working when we define the value of i inside the function? Please help sir.
def like(n):<br>    i = 1<br>    for i in range(1,n):<br>        return i<br>val = int(input(&quot;Enter your desire number:&quot;))        <br>like(val)<br>print(val)
Sir, you are great ❤❤❤ But there is one problem with all of your videos that you make a lot of cuts, and that irritates. So try to reduce it.
Plz change the title of this video to increasing recursion limit
Finally i over come FUCKING PYCHARM Cursor not automatically going to RUN WINDOW, After run i have to take my cursor to the run window each time, waste of time alhamdulillah finally i solved it. with the help of autohotkey.
sir, why in machinie i can only able to print 53 caes out  of 100 and 953 out of 1000 cases , the error which is shown is &quot;maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object&quot;

Maximum recursion limit you can set is 2099999999
:) noice
Hi, I am using Python version 3.8.3. it gave me results 2957 times without making any changes to default setting in Jupyter notebook
i done for 3000 but it stoopes at 2391
You are amazing ❤️❤️
if the limit is beyond 3000 it will not print..it will print upto 2416 only
I learned better about recursion from this video. Shukran
Sir the limit is 2416😁
Thanks for showing recursion limit. It stops the problem I&#39;ve been having
really making this quarantine period fun and useful!
I had set recursion limit to 10(to print &quot;hello&quot;), but it prints only 4 times and got some errors.. can you help me to fix them..?
Awesome, outstanding, superb, mindblowing video
Hello sir <br>Good evening. <br>I have found the way to print 2000 hello&#39;s by setting limit of recursion 2004<br>If you see this please reply to tell me that you saw it

Sir make a video to avoid time limit error in python
Thankyou so much
the limit is upto 7608 even when we sys.setrecursionlimit(20000) <br>print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
Your lectures are awesome ...simple and beautiful 😍 thank you so much
The exceeded recursion limit is 6277. Is there a way to go beyond that?
set recursion limit is 3925 you can&#39;t print beyond this

WOWWW... you are amazing Navin! You have passion for teaching.
You are the best , Sir.
I really appricated the level of explanation,👍😊
If only naruto knew this he wouldn&#39;t have failed the chunin return exams🤣🤣🤣
Fabulous Video....
Can anyone help with the code with user input. That would be helpful😊
Bravo sir!!
The way you explain is awesome❤<br>Thank You Sir
He showed how to teach in the coolest way possible 😎
oh my god.  love you sir. you are my mentor.
Sir your really great 😊👍

Steve jobs
what a creativity level man
Very good editing Sir 👏
lol
Bruhhhh the editing 🎉
the best video in whole series lol😂
I can say out of all the videos in playlist this is the most ossm one, I used to have a bad perception about recursion but your video made it way much easier it to me. Thankyou :)
this funniest part was that he was calling himself  😂 best tutorial of my life
thanks for the video
Loved it, Naveen. Best explanation!
This video made 5years back,<br>Now im new to python language im watching this video .There is no any updation right the concepts he explained?
great editing sir, thanks for explanation
One of the best explanations 🎉
Besttttttttttttttttt Bestttttttttttttttttt Explanationnnnn ever seennnnnn ❤❤❤❤
LOL. Isn&#39;t that how Ravana character used to talk to himself in old movies?!?! :P
superb sir 🥳🥳🥳<br>wonderful explanation
def fact(n):<br>    return 1 if n&lt;=1 else n*fact(n-1)<br>result=fact(5)<br>print(result)
Awesome sir.....😅💖
The best recursion explained video ever. Great 💛
Happpned like magic to me 😀.<br><br>I get the concept of factorial, I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m overthinking this whilie trying to onpterpret it into a code format.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
one of the best video i saw in  youtube till now, very impressive work sir. Thank you so much sir
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqqQld6m6A0&amp;t=2m18s"">2:18</a>
Vere level editing 🙏🥳
Nice way of explaining it !!!!
regarding recursion,<br>so here we are using fact(n-1) , which has same name as method, calling function again in a function and so it is recursion , is that right ?
Sir Reddy, you and your team are the best. The way you explained recursion was amazing, and you are truly helping me understand Python as clearly as possible. Thank you!
Amazing!!!!!
Good video, but where the n value is decreasing by 1 ?  as it is returning always n* fact (n-1)
GOOD VEDIO SIR <br>THANKS SIR
still dont get it how this code calculates it.
Sir, I have never seen anyone teach in the way that you do, since last few days i have been started to follow your videos. you are great, take love from Bangladesh ❤❤❤
Sir,it is next level explaination
That’s a good answer.please mention edge cases in code while input is negative number.
Hats off to your effort !! very well explanations !!!
The way you explain it at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqqQld6m6A0&amp;t=2m12s"">2:12</a> is so great 😂👍
Awesome way of explaining. That&#39;s a different level of editing
Sir, the way you are explaining is simply superb👏👏
This level of editing makes me more interesting to watch your videos sir
Mann !!  The explanation was nice..... I should have seen this recusrion lecture before I have visited so many videos.... <br>Even a beginner can understand in no time.
omg please never stop makin these tutorials you and harry are the only people that explain it well
Awesome explanation sir
Great! Lot&#39;s of enjoyment here the way you explained recursion. Thanks dear sir.
What a nicely you explained the recursion sir using your multiple pictures. It was Awesome!!
Python+ high level animation= Telusko ❤️❤️
What an editing sir!<br>Kudos !!!! To you teaching efforts❤️
looks like a fan of double action movies lol😂(6 heroes in one frame)
No  one can be taught me Recursion like this with awesome and high-level editing ❤...! Thank you so much for this Playlist
No can be taught me Recursion like this with awesome and high level editing ❤...! Thank you so for this Playlist
superb 👍
it&#39;s awesome
How come &quot;n&quot; is not going below 0?
Very interesting animation for recursion!! truly original and creative!!
What an explanation and effort 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
excellent job !!!!!!!!!!
best explanation
Next level teaching style 🙌🙌
Greattt way of explaining the topic!!<br>Thanks so much sir for being here on YT for us! Always grateful ✨🙌😇
plz tell me when we declare a function named simple_interest(p, t, r):<br>then afeter writing the code when we call  the fucntion inside the body why we write simple_interest(2, 3, 4) any random number instead of p, t, r .
Hey Bro, Don&#39;t talk down to yourself like that. believe in yourself and don&#39;t let nobody change your mindset of that!
damnnnn! !! great you nailed it sir👌👌👌👌👌👌
Your simply awesome 👌
Salute to your teaching loved it
Osm, never seen this kind of teaching 🤩🔥
So, appreciate man such a great teacher 💐💐
i love the way you teach sir infact everyone love your teaching method
Great Visualization...<br>Kudos!
Fun Fact: I was watching something else from his playlist but found this video with such thumbnail which got my attention to watch this video! 😁<br><br>Navin Sir, it&#39;s only because of your thumbnail which forced me to earn a view at your video 😀 Seriously it was funny as well as Concept clear Video. Thankyou for making such video👍🏻🙏🏻
such amazing editing- great way of teaching!
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
Bahubali range vfx anna adhi
Glad I learnt the concept of recursion first time from you and that like this. I&#39;d always remember it.
Still getting errors after watching the video 5 times😭
You are great sir... Your teaching way is superb
marvel approaching Navin sir for Phase 5 editing projects🔥🔥🔥,   the best and simplest explanation for recurssion Sir...Hatsoff
Really awesome
Your editing is on next level ☺️.. thank you sir for wonderful 👍👏 python course.
OMG, no one can beat you sir 👌
nice editing and explanation is superb.
With for loop also, we can try:<br>def factorial(no):<br>    fact = 1<br>    for i in range(no,1,-1):<br>        fact = fact * i<br>        factorial(no-1)<br>    return fact<br>no = 5<br>result = factorial(no)<br>print(result)
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqqQld6m6A0&amp;t=3m46s"">3:46</a> lmfao ok
The code is still incomplete. Can you guess the bug?
my teacher spent  much more time and I still could not understand, you are awesome
i have never seen anyone explaining this concept like you sir. Thanks alot for making it this much simple.
The best
No cap the best explanation of RECURSION on youtube . 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
can we use n  instead of value?"
Python for Beginners (Full Course) | Programming Tutorial,PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3,Telusko,#42 Python Tutorial for Beginners | Anonymous Functions | Lambda,hYzwCsKGRrg,278.0,492670,8684,"
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzwCsKGRrg&amp;t=0m53s"">0:53</a>
When it reaches the point where n == 0 why does it goes to 2nd return statement after returning 1 from 1st return statement? I tried putting &quot;else&quot; before the 2nd return statement still it goes there, this doesn&#39;t happen when value of n is initially 0 (when we try to calculate 0!).
We can still simply the lambda code<br><br>Output =(lambda x, y : x + y)(2, 3) <br>Print(Output)
Lambda is useless object I guess because function is for multiple uses and reduce the codes maybe we can use variables like<br>A = 10<br>B = A*A<br>Print(B)
As someone with prior knowledge of a few other programming languages(now primitive compared to python),  with this tutorial I am getting to start learning some very special programming abilities of python. Navin, if not for your tutorials, I dont think I would have come this far! ...sure, I am late for the game by a few years 😂
You are the Best teacher to learn languages, programming sir, thank you so much 🙏sir to make it simple.
simple, peaceful, and contented video!
Dear sir python mean median and mode with  list how to write a program
Why we called it as anonymous? Because f is use as a function name and It is used in program means it has function name.
You are awesome!
I generally don&#39;t comment on any video , but the way you explain this lambda concept to me, I had watched 4-5 videos earlier but none of them explained it so effortlessly and in a simple video.
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzwCsKGRrg&amp;t=0m43s"">0:43</a> uhh, increase font size 🙄
f = lambda a, b : (a+b)<br><br>a = None<br>def value1():<br>    global a<br>    valid = False<br>    while not valid:<br>        try:<br>            a = int(input(&quot;Enter value 1: &quot;))<br>            valid = True<br>        except ValueError:<br>            print(&quot;Invalid input.&quot;)<br>value1()<br><br>b = None<br>def value2():<br>    global b<br>    valid = False<br>    while not valid:<br>        try:<br>            b = int(input(&quot;Enter value 2: &quot;))<br>            valid = True<br>        except ValueError:<br>            print(&quot;Invalid input.&quot;)<br>value2()<br><br>result = f(a, b)<br>print(result)<br><br>asks user for value 1 and 2, and adds them together. User inputs are given limits (can only type in positive and negative integers).
Hi Navin, Can you please help me in finding the greatest of 3 numbers using lambda function.
Bangam bro
The way you put forward these concepts in such an easy way is absolutely commendable.  Thank you!!
I don&#39;t get how it doesn&#39;t have a name. Didn&#39;t you just name it f?
Cool explanation.
sir thank you so much for creating  these top quality videos for free
Understood this!!<br>Thanks man!!
Nice
Dude has me binging on Python tutorials.
can use for loop  in lambda?
this was one of the best i saw of python , great job python
Why do you speak very fastly? all data analysis teacher speaks fastly 😞😞😞😞😞
Thank you, Navin!
Thank you very much. Your way of explanation is awesome
sir ,with u I can pass bord exam easily . print(&quot;thankyou sir&quot;)
Thank you sir...
Can we use a conditional statement<br>In these ananymous function?<br>If yes then how?
Super sir brillant to see this video
Nice, brief, and complete. Thanks!
Add Number using Function:<br>def add(a,b):<br>    c = a + b<br>    print(&quot;Result of Sum&quot;, c)<br>add(5,8)
One of the best guide..in fun way really 😄😄
f is name it self ....How can u say no name....may its one line function
you explained it so clear and easy that I wonder how I didn&#39;t understand this from other people. I guess that makes you a good teacher! thanks!
I had a doubt:why cant you just print (a*a) and set a=5 only 2lines of code
Literally binge watching ur videos!
You will always get a 👍 from me. :) Thank you for the videos!
I click &#39;Like&#39; as first thing after opening your videos because your courses is very nice
I like you, sir, very much You have blessings from students.
Tq very much for u r presents in python
I am a python noob and I have been struggling to understand LAMBDA function and expressions. Great Explanation. Thanks from Australia
Thanks so much
You are the only python youtuber who uses simple language to teach . Thank you
best tutorial ever
Thank you so much Navin for this wonderful description. I am a new beginner.
sir please donot assign a lambda expression ka aa raha hai likha hua
Wouu ya he llegado al nivel de programacion en el que me salen videos de gente indu, estoy tan orgulloso de mi!
if your age is &lt; 13 :<br>    print (like)
Thank you !!
Thank you very much for the video! I like how you explained the backstory behind the creation of anonymous functions. It was very helpful!
Sir, can u pls tell me what role does &#39;Return&#39; keyword will play
Hi Sir, excellent. can u clarify one doubt. for practice do I want to use pycharam or jupitor. is indentation required in jupitor or not. i am learning data science . in model development nobody following indentation in jupitor. do to that reason i am asking this question
You are best python sensai
sir u r  my guru
Sir It was a good video but I believe that in lambda function we got to have parameter first (not argument), I mean that’s what I learned. I may be wrong since I am an electrical engineer who has just started learning programming since past 1 month😅 so my apologies if I was wrong and correct me if so
Write a lambda function that finds the smallest of two numbers<br>how to do it
Program to concatenate two strings using recursion
Awesome!
On YouTube i have learnt more than my school can teach me <br>😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am not able to use Lamba may I know the reason plsss
you know sir, every time I see a new chapter of python, I feel so good that you shared all these videos so well and in an easy way. Thanks again.
hi <br>lambda function works like inline function in c++?
At the near end of this video, you say anonymous function has no name !?<br>I suggest to say  no def , it still has a name to be called.<br>Most important, only one expression !<br>My opinion. Best regards.
I know that you explained it well but programming goes over my head.
x=int(input(&quot;x=&quot;))<br>f = lambda a: a*a<br>f(x)
Most of you agree, that this is one of the best and the simplest explanation for the LAMBDA expression. Thank you Navir sir for this amazing stuff. I am learning at least 4-5 topics from this playlist every day and with the first thing in the morning. Thank you once again.
I couldn&#39;t understand what is lambda, but now,  I know, you&#39;re the best python teacher in the world, thank you so much 🌹

I Didn&#39;t see this type of lecturing anywhere tq u sir a lot..... 👌👌
You forgot to run last code
You’re my favourite teacher or you can say “mentor” .
I like the way he call us  :<br><br><br> &quot;ALIENS&quot;
Sir why we use return.  Please any one explain
Thank you
Can&#39;t we use the coceptof alias here..🧐
superb***********superb
Here is my definition of Anonymous Function<br>An Anonymous Function is a function that uses the keyword LAMBDA and is only executed/expressed once i.e. there is no more use for it, like a one-time use function. Logically because it’s a one-time use function – and it won’t be referred to it at later stages in the code, it is simplified to only run once without taking extra unnecessary coding memory

such a headache of lambda syntax clarified so simply. Thankx.
I really like the way you explain concepts❤
@navin sir, How can we know that map,reduce or any other functions belongs to which module/tool?

Excellent teaching. Thank you.
another way to solve the factorial problem using the reduce fucntion<br>from functools import reduce<br>n=4<br>factorial=reduce(lambda x,y:x*y,range(1,n+1))
After watching this video my all doubt got clear hats off to sir quality and method of teaching lit.. Tx
Thank you so much the only tutorial that i can actually understand!! ♥♥
can anybody tell how sir display tht built in function to see filter (function,iterable)......plz help
This man is an absolute legend
Cant we do that with just lambda function instead of these map, reduce and filter?
if we use for loop to seperate evens than it will take time complexcity o(n)..by using lambda what is the time complexicity
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
Big Data concept is so relatable for me to understand this concept.❤❤
loved the method of your explaining
Could have explained ACCUMULATE FUNCTION too!!! :)
sir please help functools is not working
What an interesting lesson. As always, enjoyed the lesson very much.<br>I have a small problem.<br><br>In this lesson, we assigned a list to the variable &quot;doubles&quot;. in defining the function as well as when using lambda, we give two variables to take two parameters. So how does Python know which item in the list is which parameter? Also, how does it know after the doing the addition, the added number should be the first variable and the next number in the list should be the second variable.<br><br>What is the logic behind this iteration? I tried to put myself in the Python&#39;s boots (even though it doesn&#39;t have legs) :-D  but I couldn&#39;t. Can anyone offer me a helping hand?
Very helpful to me. It&#39;s crystal clear. Prior to watching this video I could not understand filter and map.
Sir, all lambda functions are working similar(filter(),map(),reduce()).<br>Then what is the main difference between them.<br>Among three which function is better to use.
Sir please start with python on these weekend it will help those people who are watching your python playlist
Nice Explanation sir
Hands down the best place to learn Python❤❤❤❤❤❤
nice!!!!!
Hey Navin sir .. wt is the difference b/w filter and map functions??
amazing thank you sir !!!!
👏👏
finally found a good tutor who does&#39;nt just dump all the codes and and leave logic behind completely making it boring and useless to watch.<br>really amazing sir.
Things starting to get tougher....
Please take care the screen, it&#39;s not clearly visible...
Sir all I can say is your perfect..
Excellent explanation !!!
from functools import reduce<br>nums = [1,2,3,4]<br>odds = list(filter(lambda n:n%2==1,nums))<br>print(odds)<br>x = list(map(lambda n:5*n, odds))<br>print(x)<br>y = reduce(lambda a,b:a+b,x)<br>print(y)<br><br>Output<br>[1,3]<br>[5,15]<br>20
Take a shot everytime he says RIGHT and OKAY!!
&#39; &#39; &#39; He is Literally Great  &#39; &#39; &#39;
are you having a job too? if yes then which one? and what have you learnt ?

Sir, can lambda functions be counted as functions? Because I typed:<br><br>is_evens = lambda n: n % 2 == 0<br><br>nums = [12, 89, 67, 34, 23, 67]<br>print(nums)<br><br>evens = list(filter(is_even, nums)) <br><br>Pls Help!
Hello Sir,<br><br>Thanks so much for the lessons. I have coded factorial of a number using reduce functions. Its working:-) <br><br>from functools import reduce<br>s=[]<br>n=int(input(&quot;Enter the number&quot;))<br>for i in range(n+1):<br>    if i==0:<br>        continue<br>    else:<br>        s.append(i)<br>print(s)<br>total = reduce(lambda a,b: a*b,s)<br>print(total)
Are u an 🇮🇳?
Thanks
why don&#39;t we use variable length argument formal args in reduce? how come using a+b it adds all. there is not (a, b*)?
thank you sir so much!!!!!!!!
This is so amazing! I learnt a whole lot about not just lambda from this video, but also these three other useful (albeit advances) functions! Thank you so much!
how to speak english like you? 🥺🥺
this was the only tutorial I undestood about map filter an reduce
Does filter work faster
How is_even function is used without round brackets in filter
Sir, explain how to write code to find factorial of a number using lambda function ....

ok ok ,,a nice and lnog explanation on filter,,how to find even and odd number,,but i like it the old school way ie iterating a loop and checking the conditions with if statements ,,as i started learning programming from c my first language
Where you learn or found a modules like functiontools, numpy plz reply back
Great lecture!

n % 2 to know if an integer is even or odd is so bad programming :’(
great presentation skills sir
oh god! you are simply answering all the questions that pop my head. thank you navin. you have no idea what a great part you are holding in my life. because of you, im fearless and ready to learn programming. thank you for saving my life.
Thank you.
Iam not getting the answer even i followed the same syntax which i did in pycharm.
You are really a fabulous teacher<br>🤩🤩🤩
Thank you !!!
The main challenge is when you are done studying and practising this and you continue with the course, someone forgets. and the query here Mr Navin is how can we interact often with these practices like say in some projects so that one knows why we are doing this, this can sink the point once.
why the function took parameters a,b from doubles? it could have taken from Evans or nums. How does it work?"

did my thinking  is good or worse<br>def div(a,b):<br>    print(a/b)<br><br>a,b=2,4<br>c=0<br>if(a&gt;b):<br>    div(a,b)<br>else:<br>    c=a<br>    a=b<br>    b=c<br>    div(a,b)
I really appreciate this. You simplified this  topic well
Excellent
Navin make telugu python teaching respect mother tounge then go for any other language, amny telugu people are eager to know in telugu, it will make us more strong in learning.
i think in this video your explaination is quite off
Thank You Telusko !!!
👍👍👍
So what i got from that is that decarators are functions that help with changing other function without messing with them right?
thanks for the video
Bro super explanation 🔥🔥🔥
Here, We defined function named Inner, but never called that function.<br>Can someone please explain why it is so?
sir i really enjoyed learning python playlist, but sir, i&#39;m totally form mechanical background and in some cases i can&#39;t understand the what is happening in the code and why it has been written and i have the dout in the decorators  i.e.<br><br>def div(a,b):<br>    print(a/b)<br>    <br>def smart_div(func):<br>    <br>    def inner(a,b):<br>        if a&lt;b:<br>            a,b = b,a<br>        return func(a,b)<br>        <br>    return inner<br><br>div1 = smart_div(div)<br>div1(3,15)<br><br>in that code why we write this function  &#39;def smart_div(func):&#39;  and  &#39;smart_div(div)&#39; code.
Thank you sir I understood this concept.
👎
this definitely helped - thanks. Can&#39;t say I still understand it to the bone, will have to re-watch, experiment &amp; fail to &#39;get&#39; it
I was smiling while watching this video. This video is amazing.❤❤❤
This is also possible in JavaScript.
The way that u teaching is difficult to understand and create more confusion..
I am a postgraduate in electronics field. I thought programming would be difficult, but u made it as simple as that. You are a great teacher. I have been working as a lecturer since 8 yrs . I have never seen a person like u, who teaches with so much of energy and enthusiasms. I have to learn many things from u -way of teaching.etc......
very helpful, thanks for the video
Sir can u do a vedio on Thread Synchronization in python..it will be more helpful..for us..i hope u will look into this
You can also decorator like this<br>def smart_div(fun):<br>    def inner(a,b):<br>        if a&lt;b:<br>            a, b = b, a<br>        return fun(a,b)<br>    return inner<br><br>@smart_div<br>def div(a,b):<br>    print(a/b)<br><br>div(45, 4)
dude, what is this accent, why is it so fake. And you seemed so confused at steps, i am a beginner and i didn&#39;t get sh*t. Kindly focus on making the topic clear instead of showing off accent.
Sir, it was displaying code 0 but, not running it was showing this : &lt;function smart_div.&lt;locals&gt;.inner at 0x000001D62CDF9DA0&gt;
This guy is a phenomenal teacher.
In if statement,the return func(a,b) i couldn&#39;t understand why
hello mr Navin, at last i found your channel about decorator.<br>thanks a lot sir!!!<br><br>God Bless
Sir excellent lecture. kindly use a little dark font for coding.
You could also do your operation by using a HOF that just receives a function as one of its arguments. No need to return another function. An example:<br><br>def division(a,b): return a/b<br>def subtraction(a, b): return a - b<br><br>def do_operation(operation, a, b):<br>    return operation(a, b) if a &gt; b else operation(b, a)<br><br>print(do_operation(division, 4, 12)) # 3.0<br>print(do_operation(division, 12, 4)) # 3.0<br>print(do_operation(subtraction, 4, 12)) # 8<br>print(do_operation(subtraction, 12, 4)) # 8
Can we not create just one function as a decorator? Why a nested function? :(( Didn&#39;t understand that part
I was working on decorator topic and also saw 2-3 videos but was not satisfied by the logic. But your teaching made me understand the concept very easily. Thank you :)
It&#39;s confusing,but I like it
from math import sqrt<br>def modify(func):<br> def inn(a):<br>  return a*a<br> return inn<br>sq=modify(sqrt)<br>print(sq(25))<br>print(sqrt(25))<br>My assignment sir 😁😁😁
whoever is the instructor, make a note of this<br><br>instead of using so many hand gestures of trying to explain about function within a function (which is a horrible way of explaining complicated things like this), try to do dry run and explain. I am just amazed that so many blind followers here blindly praised the video instead of providing genuine feedback. This video is so bad in explaining decorator because no dry run, no step by step process was explained. I am disappointed
Can anyone explain how inner function is getting arguments a and b, when smart function calls inner, it is not passing any arguments.
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
I understand the rationale for decorators now. eg you don&#39;t have control of the existing function and you dont have control of input data.
Now I understand WHY I would use a decorator ... simply illustrated and simply understood. We all learn differently and this was concise.
One major thing I noticed that fancy method which is actually a decorator should be written first else gives an error.Unresolved reference &#39;method_name&#39;
Please anyone answer&gt; Why are we using return inner rather than return inner(a,b) or return inner()? if we are returning inner method then how the method is being returned without ().
😐😕didn’t get it 🥲
sir as u said that if the pre-existing function is in another file and u are importing  it from there ...then we shouldn&#39;t be knowing the name of the function so how will we use decorators then,.....please clear my doubt sir
In my code return () statement is not working . Can you tell me what&#39;s the solution is this .
Could someone suggest practice website
I am fail to understand this vedio of decorators can you please explain it in better way.only this vedio
amazing
Why we return func(a,b) anyone help me please
sorry to say this navin reddy pls take another tutorial on decorators .I didn&#39;t understand this
Really you have  great teaching skill sir.... Thanks for explaining decorators🙏
For people saying missing @ in the tutorial, please find the equivalent usage done by the tutor. You could either go with<br>div=smart_div(div) or use @&lt;decorator_name&gt; like @smart_div on top of function div. Both are same
Why you using this func()?
isnt it best practice to put *args, **kwargs in the decorator?
Basically there is a missing point, that is we have to use “@“ for using decorators after defining them. And even wrapper functions explanations are missing
I&#39;ve seen some people use classes instead of functions to create the decorator. He implemented the <i>_init_</i> and <i>_call_</i> functions within It and that was it. Can someone explain what&#39;s the difference between using classes and functions?
Most coding teachers cannot explain anything. You can. This made sense.
Function parameters are easy in Haskell, F-sharp etc
please sir  anybody tell me that where i can do coding in android phone
If decorated is not there in python then how can you do it? can you plz answer this
Hallo Navin ,, this is great 👍🔥
Your presence makes the video so much better✨️
Why is this better than a plain, straightforward call to the original function inside a new function without all the abstraction of decorating? This video is great at explaining the mechanics, but even one sentence as to why they are superior would be great.
I have two functions which is used for serial com and other is ssh which is used to connect to target ...How to develop wrapper combining these two
we can use @deco keyword<br>for calling
we are passing  func as input parameter of the fucnction how could that be working can you expalin in deatil
Sir, Thank U for making decorators so easy. I have watched many videos but did not understood anything. Thanku and a great respect from Kerala 😊😊
Hello, i just realized that this works. is it okay to follow this approach? <br>Forgive the indent here 😄<br><br>def div(x,y):<br>        print(x/y)<br><br>def smartDiv(a,b):<br>       if a&lt;b:<br>           a,b= b,a<br>           print(a/b)<br>        else:<br>               print(a/b)<br>       return smartDiv<br><br>div = smartDiv<br>div(2,6)<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23will"">#will</a> print 3.
Thank you so much sir.
Hi Naveen,<br>If you prepare videos on Excel reading and writing.. would be very helpful. If time permits pls do the needful. Thanks 👍
You don&#39;t know how to teach so that listeners can understand ,,, you are doing it yourself 👎 but we are not getting
if we want to modify a function later we can modify it later without using decorators also. Then why do we use decorators??
what is the use of using 10 lines code in the program. it is simple to use 4 lines of code without using decoraters .
How inner function is getting executed without calling it?
suppose the div() function was in a different file after importing it to a new file and changing using decorator......so will the div() in the original file change??
Really impressed! Actually I&#39;ve been through 4-5 videos before, but no one cleared my doubts this easily, that also in just 7 minutes. ❣️<br>Really loved it.
Quite a confusing video 😴 or maybe the concept is a little hard to grasp.
your teaching style tooooooooooooo impressive
this looks complicated. is it im<br>portant to have decorators
def smart_div(func):<br><br>    def inner(a,b):<br>        if a&lt;b:<br>            a,b = b,a<br>        return func(a,b)<br>    return inner<br><br>@smart_div<br>def div(a,b):<br>    <br>    print(a/b)<br><br>div(2,4)
Sir please explain about what is random walks
dimagh k esii ki tessii ho gaiey yaar! decorators are difficult to understand
if we don not  take the inner function will we be able to access the parameters of div?
Sir, may I know the reason for returning inner function?
Decorators are one of things added to the list of &quot;Never Use Unless you Want to Ruin Your Program&quot;.  Tread carefully.
Amazing explanation..sir...thank you thank you so much
I wish you modularized the code, smat_div function in another file :(
A lot of arm waving but no motivation as to why one would use an inner function.  I think the answer is that inner functions are created so that the inner function changes the behavior of the original function without changing the original function.  That is a decorator is a made up construct.<br><br>,Also, what happened to the notation using “@“?
How&quot; inner &quot; function got executed<br>With out calling it🙄
how does inner get called and when? what i have understood is we are passing the div function as parameter to the decorator function, which is returning inner_function. Now, the inner_function object or address will be overridden in the ‘div’ because we are capturing the returned function in it. After this, whenever we call div, the execution goes to inner_function in the decorator.
was bit tricky to understand
This is the best example I found to understand decorator...😀
Why don&#39;t we return the same passed function in decorators?
Hey Navin, Thank you for sharing your amazing knowledge with you, This is the first video in 44 videos which I found a bit harder to grasp.
I just realized that you being physically present in the video makes such a big difference to how much attention I pay. There are tons of videos out there but your videos work for me because there is someone teaching and I can see them typing the code. The expressions and gestures also help with the learning, maybe subconsciously we understand better if knowledge transfer is backed by facial expressions. Thanks again for choosing to share your knowledge, for free!

Emnglish ke chomde log 😓😓😓
I couldn&#39;t do it..... After executing the program it was showing no module named calc was found.... But I saved it correctly... Can u please help me?
If you create your own module, wouldn&#39;t you have to remember all the function names that you created to call it?  Also, there is now double the chance that soemthing could go wrong-- the code in the module that you created plus the code in the main console.
Try to speak slower.
I am learning python from 3 years , but in the experiance of this 3 years I have morely like only this stuff, because it is really - really insane 🤯🤯

#45 &amp; #46 are same ch video  ..but thank u soo much mr.reddy for this 112 tutorial  videos
after watching a 5 min video i learn what is <i>_name_</i>  and <i>_main_</i> , where i read almost 2 hours but can&#39;t catch nothing!
This guys every tutorial is like Arrahman songs....you need to watch couple more times to understand and enjoy the music.
thank you so much sir great explanation
TQ so much sir
How to print the calc statement in demo file after _name_??
The videos are very helpful and informative videos sir and that is the only reason I could learn python in this efficient way.Thank You sir.
Watching 3rd time.. got the concept.. awesome.. thanks....
Very bad explanation
It was helpful sir<br>Thankyou &lt;3
Great way to explain it! I watch like 2 videos before this one and I was more confused than when I started. lol Thank you sir. Bravo
why are you using light IDE  theme it is the worst😑
Video not Playing 😕
Placed my two hands on my heads and shouted &quot;wow&quot;

Not satisfied :((
Damn Finally I got it :)

Sir I try to do it in the python script mode but it&#39;s not working
Summary of this video <br>1-They are two modules name demo and calc <br>2- when you are working on demo and print(_name )<br>Output- _main_(because it is starting point of a code)<br>3- Now we will work on calc and print hello <i>name</i><br>Output- hello <i>main</i> <br>This is happening and it is giving name as main output because we are working on same module <br><br>Now when we import one module to other ( import calc to demo)<br>1- All the things in calc will be printed along with demo statements<br>2- but it will print hello calc (the module name )<br>Instead of hello main <br>Because we are importing it to other module <br>&quot;sooo when you are importing it in same module it will give name output as main <br>And if in other module it will give name output along with module name...... that&#39;s it❤<br><br>Thanku sooo much sir great work <br>Lots of blessing by one of your alien😅❤
I understand it now! Thank you genius! You explanation is so cool ❤️
I think what people miss is... The fact that how YOU ENTER INTO THE PROGRAM! for the people this isn&#39;t making sense need to understand, the entry into your program. In other languages, the concept is a bit different yet the idea is same
Bro you r awesome... 🤩🤩🤩🤩..  I like you way of explanation ❤️...
<i>_name_</i>
great video
You are awesome thanks
just randomly found <i>__name__</i> == &quot;__main__&quot; , now got know the use, sir  u made it easy peasy😀
It&#39;s double underscores...it was not working for single underscore<br>Print(__name__)
could u explain it in some easy ways?
thank you anna
You&#39;ve beaten my instructor and made my concept clear.<br>Gratitude.
Could also do a video how <i>_name_</i> is used together with passing arguments into the script? :)
Sir but the point of importing is to use it as an extension in another file or function or program  which is benifit Fromm that import file .<br>So if I write it as main then the import function nwill not do its job and you cannot add the functionality tonthennew program. So whats the use of main then
Thank you so much !
Thank You for all the efforts that you&#39;ve made to make this video. This is a very helpful and informative video and I was able tot understand everything clearly. It also helped me perform better in school.
This Man is awesome...Thank you for your good work. as simple as that...
still very useful today thank you
Could not comprehend this from my book. Thanks for the explanation!
Sir when you said welcome back &#39;aliens&#39; it feels  main dusre brhamand se aaya hun😁
Light attracts bugs.
You are Awesome 🔥
Hello. How to type double underscore from keyboard. Thanks
You are excellent sir !  Thanks alot!
Really, brilliant brilliant explination. Love your flow, very easy for my brain to follow.
Great explination!
Thank you so much. Very clearly explained
Just to improve your Englis pal. You try to talk to quickly... it is a bed idea. Talk slowly bro. @Telusko
you explained better than codewithharry &lt;3
You are a god!
I watched other youtube videos too on this topic, trust me, no one can make you understand better than our Naveen sir... :)  Hats off to you sir... Just ignore negative people&#39;s comments and keep teaching your loving &quot;Aliens&quot;   :)
Sir, its understandable, no need of new video on this topic. I too was bit confused initially but watched again, understood.  One can try last minute program n understand. If name is main, then only execute main otherwise if its imported as a library in second module,  then main function will not be executed ... that&#39;s it... :)
Let me smash that thumps up button !
Thanks !!!
This was still too confusing 😵
Once you watch it a couple times it really starts to make a lot of sense. Thank you
Navin bro I luv you...you changed my life😊👍
Fantastic video, god I with more people would just get straight to the point you like do lol
It make me to get it by 2 time watch but it worth
Too verbose, mate
Where can i get your full Python tutorial in one video???
Iam watching python videos because of you sir
A mystery man ❤ great man 🤝
print(_name_)<br><br>Im getting Name is not defined<br>Any help please
So, I was wondering from months , why do we use it. Today , my doubt got cleared finally . Thanks telusko
Guys if you get confused, please watch the previous video about modules and understand the concept clearly. Then watch this video slowly and try to understand each thing Navin Sir is trying to explain. Things will be crystal clear. &lt;3
after so many videos and forums about <i>_name_</i> and __main__, finally this video let me understand clearly what is it and what it does. Thanks!
sir ,why this one doesn&#39;t work in python IDLE i.e the second part which you told about taking &quot;demo&quot; as module
Very sharp
I&#39;m enhancing by watching one by one video sir that&#39;s really great explaining....👍👍
Sir, in python Idle, it is showing &quot;&quot;name is not  defined&quot;&quot;, can you help me with this
It is the damn clear explanation... Thank you, sir.
I can bet every Java and C++ developer understood this"

Great explanation. Thnx for this follow up video.
This was a bit more clearer than the prev. video ! Thanks for clarification and it even helps understand in 2023...
Hye! Can you please explain that if we are using print(main()) then why an extra none string is printing?
Understood now thank you sir
In simple way you could say that when we run the py file we want to skip the execution of other function to be called after importing in your file. Becasue when we load our page the variable which you spoke about that <i>_name_</i> Once we print it it gives the output of <i>_main__, So While loading the page we check we want ti execute code only WHEN out constion __name_</i> == &quot;__main__&quot; is TRUE.!!! This is simple nothing much complicated.!

That was an amazing explanation!
Now only i understood😂😂
Very well explained! Thanks
from tamilnadu  in india u are just awesome👽👽 2023
wonderful explanation
the best thing about him is discussing the errors about certain topics that can occure. Thanks .
If you have program a and program b <br>If you wanna use program bs function in program a<br>You don’t have to execute all the function present in program b n you need only one function from program b in program a<br>In that case we can check special variable and execute required function in program a
Hi Navin sir, I tried the same thing in the jupyter notebook. But, when I run the add function it only prints the add statement and not the complete module. Please help. <br><br>Any help would be appreciated. THANKS
now it&#39;s clear to me...thanks
Underscore symbol&quot;_&quot; is used twice in <i>_name_</i> , if we use only one time , it will give error
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
The best explanation on YouTube
Nice explanation!
Hello sir on my side the name function is not working
Excellent explanation.... the best
It would have been better if you used, just a whiteboard or a 2D sketch to explain the concept behind this. It would be spoon-feeding I know, :-D <br>But it would increase the efficiency. As always another great lesson.

I get it but I don&#39;t... <b>tears</b>
too complicated
I personally wish, you should make sub videos for every main videos. Because sub video is more clear and explained than main videos. It&#39;s true?
No doubts sir
Thanx for clearing my doubt in part 2

I was learning python in Linkedin Learning and got confused , i get back here , saw this and now I&#39;m learning from here... Thankyou Sir😀😀😀😀
Why it&#39;s havin play button when we write __name__=main... Some one can help
Thank u Naveen, i clearly understood the concept from the second lecture
this was a much needed one..tysm sir
Thanks
his videos really deserve a like.. Guys plz like his videos..<br>these are some crazy paid content that he is providing for free..
This is hard to understand.<br>I should watch another channel for this topic😔💔
Don&#39;t know why this concept is so hard for me to take 💔
Addicted
Hello Navin,I want to ask if two modules has function of same name,then how to remove conflict. when we write from calc import add. And <a href=""http://demo.py/"">demo.py</a> also has add func
You are the best, my concepts are  really good after watching your videos. You explain the concepts in the easiest way possible and thats the beauty.
This clearly explains the <i>_name_</i> keyword. I found this a better explanation than the first one. Anyways, great job as always.
Sir I can not understand the special variable _name_,how can help this variable in program,can you help me sir <br>Anyone please can me teach you?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hjgRn-vfVQ&amp;t=4m45s"">4:45</a> but we are not importing calc library/module, we are importing the function add() from <a href=""http://calc.py/"">calc.py</a> (by using &#39;from Calc import add&#39;).<br>am i wrong?
his videos talk about his experience and skills in the field of software development. thanks for sharing your beautiful content with us.
hey, Thanks Navin, this video clears the concept for the main very well.
Thanks sir
Sir, Calc module  does not support in my pycharm?what should i do?
great sir
Thanks, I think my all doubts are gone about __name__!
feeling lot better<br>now thanks for the second part
If we import more than two modules<br>Then what is the result of <br>Print (__name__)????????<br>If you clarify my doubt I willl give you thumbs up 👍
Thank you
SIR . How can i create new module in idle python please help me out.
Now this is totally ok. last video was too fast to get
Awesome taeching pattern. Thnk you very ❤️💪
greatt!!!!
Beautifully explained,pls do make a video on dynamic programming
best teacher
Sir u r great i get it completely
in the last video i thought that we can only make one module as &quot;main&quot; but <br>this video(part 2) cleared that whichever u make ur &quot;main&quot;<br>while importing give condition else it will execute the whole module...thank u
Thank you very much. This video helped me a lot.💕💕
I have a doubt that when we import only add then why it&#39;s calling main again 😒🤯
much better now sir
awesomeeeee
Awesome Explanation
How the if condition works in calc ,when the  import statement in demo is like &quot; from calc import * &quot; ...can u clarify my doubt sir?
sir this videos had better explanation then lec#46
you are the best OMG!!!!
Thank you!!!
sir please include c languge all videos in one playlist.<br>its difficult to find all videos.<br>please sir do it<br>and as a beginners it is very difficult to watch it in perfect secquence.
Finally I understood 😊🙏
Perfect explanation thanks
You are awsm sir 🙋
for me this thing is not getting in
Thanks for this video!
Hai Navin, I like your videos, I wish you have a series for all important libraries covered, could u plz suggest any link?
The <i>_name_</i> is <i>_main_</i> in his own file only if u try to call in the function like in another file add(), sub()... <br> As an example:  <br>def sum():<br>    print(&quot;sum value is from &quot;,__name__)<br><br>  Then it will print the file name, if u calling sum() in another file, so it will print the name from where sum() belongs to. <br><br>so the logic is <i>_name_</i> will never be <i>_main_</i> in another file so it will not print the entire main() function.
cool....keep the play back speed to 0.75 and see everything will be clear. And thank me Later.
sir<br>First we imported only add from cal <br>the why it executed whole cal module<br><br>so there is no difference between,<br>&quot;from cal import add&quot; and &quot;from cal import *&quot;
No words to say excellent sir
In last video i was pretty confused , but now its totally clear
Tq for make this video
Simply you are the best teacher i have ever come across
really amazing
Perfectly clear now. Thank you for this second video to clarify.
Best video 😍
somebody give this guy a medal. thank you sir.
Clear sir thanks for this video for the clarity
Previous video was a little bit confusing ...but now I get it.... thanks for this video...and lots of love☺️☺️☺️
this definitely has made me understand how important it is to know the <i>_name_</i> variable. Thank you so much!
Thank you sir, now everything is ok and clear...
I understand ur teaching at fisrt Glance sir....👌👌🤝🤝
What i  understood from this is.. If there are any executable statements in the imported module.(like function calling, print statement, input etc) after definning all functions. (I am from c background i dont know what is the exact word instead of  &quot;compiler&quot; in python ) the compiler will first execute those  executable statements which are present in calc. Py module and the executes  the executable statements in demo. Py...<br>There is a problem only in starting.. If u dont want statement of calc or importing module which are present after defining of function use  condition <i>_name_</i> == __main__.. As told by sir...<br>Once try you will understand better
Previous Video is more clear guys have patience and watch carefully
Thank you so much, sir. I was a hit confused understanding about <i>_main_</i> concept in the earlier video. Now this video  cleared all my latter doubts.
This video was needed as the last video was little bit confused....Thank you So much Navin Sir...you are awesome ☺️
good if you can slow down the speed
Very clear video, watching it twice will 100% clear your doubts.  <b>Twice</b> for slow learners."

You are so so so sharp and talented.... ❤❤
Another analogy for class and object is<br>Lets take Pizza, <br>The recipe  instruction and ingridients is class.if you know the recipe you can create pizza and the pizza is object.
why there is shitty background, video is good but never keep moving object behind you.

I am absolutely loving this series. I&#39;m moving along with Python so quickly.<br><br>Only criticism I have is in the explanation of Class and Instance.  It&#39;s not that you don&#39;t get there, but it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re skirting around the simple answer:  Seems that the best way I&#39;ve seen this described is to say that when you ask someone about a thing...  What is this?  It&#39;s a phone.   That&#39;s it&#39;s class.  The class is phone.  We know from this, the basic attributes (It&#39;s size, weight, and color), but when we ask what <del>TYPE</del> of phone it is, we&#39;re then talking about an Instance.  IT&#39;s instance is the Motorola Nifty Call &amp;trade;, and it has the same attributes as the class (phone), but in the instance of it we see that things are different.  Bigger or smaller, more memory, faster processor etc.   This leads us into understanding inheritance, and polymorphism in later videos.   <br><br>I LOVE THE WORK HERE!!!
👽👽👽👽
I find myself here without difficulty or efforts of climbing high cliffs but still took the gradual climb up the hill without being tired, to get to a place called OOPs ...I feel you (Navin, respectfully) transitioned us from simple programming, building all the foundation and setting the stage without us knowing, to OOP. ...nice approach, not to mention the very likeable way you teach like many others have already mentioned. Feel so fortunate to have found your tutorials
It&#39;s still called a China phone in India. JK :P :B
Finally I understood OOPs ! Thank You. Great teaching skills.
Excellent. I couldn’t find any more words to describe ur teaching. kudos
That&#39;s awesome right 👌👌👌
Thanks!!
Loved the way you explain the concepts with simple examples
After 4 years, still this video id best
Explained a semesters long concept in seven minutes and one second, so much love for your project on youtube!
Thanks alot 🙏
Finally
Anna excellent  teaching and wonderful examples
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
Take away from the lesson: (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZwPdqC2Os0&amp;t=6m35s"">6:35</a>) An Object is an instance of a Class
Don&#39;t go anywhere <br>The best explanation is here
Thanks alot navin sir easy explanation and your communication skills is good
Unbelievable, the way you fixed it in our mind. So appreciated ❤️
Extraordinary 👌
very interesting and easy explanation... more than a perfect teacher .. thanks a lot
Thanks

wow after 48 videos i noticed you are using green screen...lectures are so interactive i didnt even noticed background...
Pure chance that as you were speaking about the mapping of objects in the real ad virtual world - the green screen appeared.  Or was this very clever teaching device?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZwPdqC2Os0&amp;t=2m27s"">2:27</a> In real world everything is an object!
your lectures are WAYAaay better than the ones that my company has recommended. the only thing, in this video, is that the background is a bit trippy.
Your real time example was tooo useful to understood class and objects 🍁

If we had teachers like you in our online classes... It could&#39;ve been way more fun than they could ever be... Love you loads sir❤️
can you tell any website type of thing to practice output of OOP and inheritance and types of inheritance
finally you explained classes and objects
best videos still the date abt opps intro n abt class
Very nice tutorial, please make tutorial on Pandas...
Thank you so much My Friend! I am taking Python course currently and find it really hard to comprehend &quot;Classes&quot;. Your videos were REALLY helpful and they saved me ;) Thank you! Keep doing great job ;)
Wow! what a great way to explain OOPs, Thank you!
programming is fun when we get a teacher like you. thanks a lot
moto g3 and iPhone :p<br><br>Jokes apart, lots of thanks. You saved us from understanding this awesome concept from boring lectures :D
The best tutorial I recommend for Python in YouTube ✌️<br>ThankYou Sir<br>God bless 💯
I never studied or worked on oops supported language and never studied any languages in engineering(since am not from programming stream). When i work on python, i was in need to know about OOPS concept. After seeing the complete video, now i say &quot;I KNOW OOPS&quot;. Thank you for crispy and timely explanation and you have kept videos in proper  order. I suggested many peoples to look on your videos for python.
This is what we call digital education... Representation is superb Sir
This is awesome!!!
Keep up the work brother, absolutely it!!
Finally i understood the difference between classes and objects with this example....thank u for sharing ur knowledge with us:-)
Woo Hoo, finally We have entered in OOPs
Awesome explanation...
Meanwhile Green Screen... My reaction be like🤭
Thank you!!

Beautiful explanation
I had previously studied this concept many times  but I did not understand <br>thanks for  making this concept clear to me  :)
I wasn&#39;t understanding <b>classes and objects</b> , but sir made it very easy for me by giving so many real life example.<br>Thank You Sir
loved the way you explain...after seeing your vedio these are becomes like pizza to me .. love to have any time ..evertime...they they alll are awesome
Crystal clear concepts😍. Youtube has The best python series only by <b>Telusko</b>
You are awesome
clarified
This is explained so clearly and in depth. Real time examples makes easy to remember for a long time.
In the second part of special variable i get understood all the main concept about modules and modules name thank you so much for your special effort <br>wish you luck for your upcoming bright future.
What is the difference between instance and object??, if they are similar then why an instance word came into picture??
Thanks in a million. Awesome.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZwPdqC2Os0&amp;t=6m05s"">6:05</a> i got it he uses green screen to do all this stuff hahahhaahh but fine its ok every one do that
&quot;Every employee for me is an object&quot; - That didn&#39;t sound well XD
At last, Finally Understood what is Class and Object. Really Telusko you&#39;re the Best

Superb exaplanation
Sir,Hats off to <a href=""http://you.best/"">you.best</a> teacher ever.
U should have to taken functions in different names rather than fun1 and fun2 and should write print statments to understand better .Not a python lover ,but still u nailed it.
After watching this video i clearly differentiate between oop programing  , functional programing and procedural oriented programing ... And i understood the class and the object clearly .
&quot;Every employee is an object&quot;<br>This line is a slap

best tutorial I came across to understand about Classes in python. Thank you!
Excellent explanation.
effective explanation...Really appreciate sir
Bro, I was confused about python class for so long. It took 10 minutes probably for you to make it clear. You are great and so efficient.
Thank you for teaching us 🙏
Awesome
Thank you sir the class and object topic is hard but u explain these in easyway
Yes, the session is helpful. Thank you.
&#39;Really helped me understand object better
I have watched so many videos on classes and this is the one i needed! Thank you

class eleventh :<br>	def config(self) :<br>		print(&quot;omkar is topper of class&quot;)<br>		<br>ele = eleventh()<br>eleventh.config(ele)
You are getting error cause not using self I think !! Let&#39;s see😅 <br>Edit: no Error cause of Not using Comp1!!<br>But you haven&#39;t teach how &quot;self&quot; word is there🤔🤔
Thanks for saving me 😌
Thankyou So much for making learning so easy and bite-sized
Крутой ты чувак, Навин. Спасибо за видео :)
can you pls make a video on  data scientist
Thanku
Sir R u from India?
Love From Bangladesh Dear Alien
I don&#39;t think I have ever seen anybody enjoy teaching as much as he does! Thank you :)
Literally best teacher 🙏🏻♥️✨
yeah this was helpful.thank you sir
Welcome Back , Aliens
I love your ‘method’ of teaching. You acknowledge how beginners don’t understand how this stuff works. So working your way back and making everything clear was very helpful. Thank you!
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O5kX73OkIY&amp;t=0m13s"">0:13</a> hey navin ,i use scala 😄
If you have come this far both you and navin(sir)  are legend.
What a great teacher he is , makes every concept crystal clear. I hope that you got blessed with YouTube algorithm so that your channel got recommended to each person who wants to learn coding.
bruh is a fucking legend for this video
okay<br> so finally i am cleared what classes and objects actually <br>thank you so much sir
let me know about your python IDE///??
I understood all vedios only problem with ep - 48,49,50
Sir , your way of approaching is good. I learned python upto an intermediate level..but wanted to go further and here your videos are helping me a lot. Its very systematic with reasoning, &quot;why&quot; , &quot;how&quot; and &quot;when&quot; to use all these. Just can you elaborate about &quot;class&quot; with some definitions .Thank You
Bro hindi m bhi bna do
I just replaced com1 and com 2 with asus and dell respectively -- and it sunk into the brain
I have been looking for a solution to my problem. finally, I got one. Thank you, sir.
The best tutorial on classes
That music at starting makes me motivate to see the entire video
what if we make an object of two different classes with same name.<br>And try to call it like com1.config()<br>How will python know that com1 belongs to which class?<br>eg-<br>class gopi:                                      <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23creating"">#creating</a> a class with name gopi<br>    def alu(self):<br>        print(&quot;alu is v good&quot;)<br>class papi:                                      <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23creating"">#creating</a> a class with name papi<br>    def alu(self):<br>        print(&quot;alu is v bad&quot;)<br>good=gopi()                                     <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23creating"">#creating</a> an object good with class gopi<br>good=papi()                                     <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23creating"">#creating</a> an object good with class papi<br>good.alu()                                        <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23how"">#how</a> will python know good belongs to which class?
Awesome Awesome
I wish i have teacher like u 😍
Awesome one! Much intuitively explained in contrast with a number of other places I tried. Went straight in. Looking forward to watching a great explanation again in lecture #50. Thanks Navin!
Way easier to understand than any other online platforms ❤️❤️
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O5kX73OkIY&amp;t=9m01s"">9:01</a> This is where Python and Java are similar. I love this course as Navin sir compares Python with Java at many instances to make things clear for students like me, who is switching from Java to Python. 😀🎉
What is with the aliens
I can give anything for this teacher😭😭😭 <br>I am crying, because atlast I found a good good good teacher
Thanks bro. lovely session.
well explained sir. Thanks for such amazing videos...
The you explained is just amazing. I wouldn&#39;t be able to understand this concept without you🖤
who wants to lean excel = technology fot teacher and students watch the whole playlist in the description
Please try to make a series on pygame as well. 🙏
Its very helpful for me :)
I had many doubts in class but your explanation was so helpful and I liked it a lot. Thank UUUUU😀😃😃
Mehn you are the best, your explanations are clear and one is able to understand.......thank you

You are getting half of my salary, when i get job with this python skill.<br>You are a wonderful teacher.. Thanks alot
I&#39;ve been struggling with this for months. Finally, after this video, I think I understand. Thank you!
Could your please full information about special variables
I am finding it kind of complicated to grasp
Brilliantly concepts are cleared.... I have never watched such explaination.... Great Job. Thanks

Not working Vs code editor
This topic was little confusing
I m not geeting where we use it in which case … I never did work in python
May I know why my __ in PyCharm does not work?
Jkakkas sir ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am getting an error - computer() takes no arguments . Can someone help here please
I am from a C# background. Normally in C# we have constructors when dealing with classes and if you don&#39;t create one the compiler in the background creates a default constructor for you and it  is named after the class name. Is the <i>_init_</i> concept the same as a class constructor?
I am facing difficulty to understand the concept clearly,
Your explanation is awesome.
I enjoyed this video
Best concise explaination ever💝❤️
I need more practice to absorb these. Thanks for the video! it rocks
Very helpful!
Irony is, I was taking a Udemy course on python and I was having trouble understanding a few concepts so I quickly looked up for telusko learning and Bingo!! I have my doubts cleared. Thanks a lot Sir.. you are one of the best educators out there.
self=this
i have copy pasted your program and it is not working please do help
superrrrrrr
thanku you
my wife!!!!missed you!!!
This is very confusing I saw this video 3 times, the last 50 videos I understood very easily
Thanks, this is the first video where I actually understood what&#39;s going on here.
Sir I have faced some error .... In output comes up wrong.. computer has no arguments how to handle this error sir
the moment I run the code it says: Type Error: computer() takes no arguments<br>I dont know why, I wrote exactly what you did...<br>any idea??
class Computer:<br><br>    def __init__(self,cpu, gpu, ram, hdd):<br>        self.cpu = cpu<br>        self.gpu = gpu<br>        self.ram = ram<br>        self.hdd = hdd<br><br>    def SysConfig(self):<br>        print(&quot;Config IS &quot;, self.cpu, self.ram, self.gpu, self.hdd)<br><br>    def GamingPC(self):<br>        print(&quot;Welcome To Avi&#39;s Gaming World &quot;)<br><br>    def main(self):<br>        Computer.GamingPC(self)<br>        print()<br>        Computer.SysConfig(self)<br><br><br>obj1 = Computer(&#39;Ryzen 5 5600X&#39;, &#39;16 GB&#39;, &#39;Nvidia RTX 3050&#39;, &#39;1TB&#39;)<br>obj1.main()

code does not work: computer() takes no arguments
Nice 😁
I see a good quality tutorial video, I hit like and subscribe the channel.
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
thank you, very nicely explained
Great explaination!
gold
so, what&#39;s being passed to self?  this is confusing
Great Explanation. You explain difficult concepts very easily. Thanks a ton!
I’m getting name error in same code
Hi, can you briefly describe <i>_init_</i> and self method. Still have some doubt
I started reading 2 books to unserstand methods error and it was not until I found this video that everything started making bit more sense. You sir a revelation.
Motta on 🔥📛
I like the way he purposely made mistake ,just to let us know more about subject
found just a bit complicated, may be becoz i&#39;m studying for first time. Having fun though.
Sir iam not consistent because the next month there&#39;s my exam 🙃 I will manage it and watch your video daily
Sir , please suggest a laptop under 50,000
Video timing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIP3-woodlU&amp;t=4m04s"">4:04</a> can not we use 2 parameters -CPU AND RAM in config func rather use init???
Good video editing but your lectures are not for beginners for sure. Experienced person may get understanding but for beginners no. Like <i>_init_</i> you are directly defining self, passing value etc.
we can&#39;t see codes properlly please do it in a darktheme
Ur theme is Soo determined to kill my eyes 👁️👄👁️
OMG!!!! I wish I knew that init method and self had so much of detailing..<br>Amazing explaination 😎🥳
best...sir.....best teacher.
You just forgot to tell that surprise (name).
Using many init function with many instances, under one class is possible??
so this is actually &quot;this.&quot;
Getting confusing now.
everything&#39;s good but hes using light mode
Thankyou so much for such awesome tuotorial❤It helped me alot.Stay blessed
nahin smjh aya ye video
but how did the programme know that we were asking for comp1,s specs or comp2,s specs ??
After reading so many coments till now on each videos , that how they faced many difficulties to learn concept in prog , i m feeling very lucky that i started learning programming for the very 1st time and i got u sir....reallyy u r blessing for us and blessing in disguise for many students ....realy u educate us    jai hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
Why underscore for init method ...?
every time i watch telusko learnings videos, i wanted to comment whats missingin the videos but, i am failing i cant find a single flaw in the video even in animations. ThankYou sir
What is the exact meaning of underscores here I mean &quot;__&quot;init&quot;__&quot;
Self means?
Wow, you made understanding classes, init, Self, and variables so much simpler. I&#39;m going from feeling lost to understanding this topic on such a deeper level. As someone new to this I needed all the help I can find. Thank you for such a good paced and passionate lesson!
thanku for providing such a video plz make more video
Good
The most amazing video explaining the init method ever.<br>Thank you so much
com1=computer(i5,16)<br>com2=computer(rhezem3,8) it shows the arguments is not defined? pls help(it shows in yellow letters you know that
Thank you!
Made topic crystal clear❤️
pls use dark theme dude 😖😖
i dont know about others but i didnt understand what you are trying to say , can you please speak slowly.
can be pass that arguments &#39;cpu&#39; &amp; &#39;ram&#39; directly in method-config?
self is equal to this in java
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIP3-woodlU&amp;t=6m01s"">6:01</a> its Encapsulation -&gt; Binding data with methods :)
Finally THE ROCK(My brain)!!! HAS UNDERSTOOD THE CONCEPTS OF OOPS lalalalaa...........
Nuv devudivi swamy
Amazing content, very clear and to the point. One recommendation for anyone feeling that tutor speaks too fast (I felt the same). I watched the video at 0.75 playback speed and it helped.
Telusko you are an Indian? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justasking"">#justasking</a>
But function variables scope is till it&#39;s function only how can you use it in other function config
Not able to understand at the beginning I understood ,facing little bit difficult am from non it background am not able to build the logic for the programs please give me some tips
We can write computer().config() also instead of writing again in different line
you are the man fratello mio....didn&#39;t understand a thing from my professor, you showed me the way
Hi, that was precisely explained. Just one clarification - when we create an instance, self is passed in init(). That would mean first an empty instance must be getting created somewhere, and then that instance is being passed in init(), where the statements within init() are executed. Please let me know if this understanding is correct as without an instance, what would you pass in init&#39;s self argument?
getting error as &#39;computer takes no arguments&#39;
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIP3-woodlU&amp;t=6m00s"">6:00</a>! what&#39;s the name?
tq
Good explanation.
sir explain pandas also

Why didnt u used c1.age==c2 in if to compare?
This is sort of enlightening. Eye opener. Thanks.
thanks wont be enough for you but thanks
And heap memory, that is just for Python, or also other languages like Bash?
Great video as always. There seems to be an important point missing: there is a <i>_eq_</i> method that classes can implement and with which they can define the behavior of the equality operator (&quot;==&quot;).
Anyone who can assist me in gaining a better understanding of this Professor&#39;s explanation?
thank you sir
I couldn&#39;t compare c1 with c2 when tried the same code .
how to use pytube
Been coding in python for the last 3 years. Understood what self means today😂
Did anyone understand the depth of it guys😢😢
Using a function in a condition could be confusing for first time programmers, under the impression that this tutorials are for first time programmers.<br>Rather introduce a variable that will hold the results from the compare method then use that variable in the condition. Yes it will take 1 or 2 more lines and more memory but for explaining purpose it makes thing more simpler. Love the videos by the way
Thank you sir ❤️
I am getting below error in pycharm. Can someone help.<br>    print(u1.name)<br>          ^^^^^^^<br>AttributeError: &#39;User&#39; object has no attribute &#39;name&#39;<br><b>************************************************************</b><br>Code<br><br>class User:<br><br>    def __int__(self):<br>        <a href=""http://self.name/"">self.name</a> = &#39;XXX&#39;<br>        self.age = 30<br><br><br>u1 = User()<br>u2 = User()<br><br>print(u1.name)<br>print(u1.age)
Things are getting complicated but still, it is the best explanation so far!
Sir your way of explanation is top class ! Totally made the concepts clear. Thank you
Why does 2 user-made class object have different ids whereas the integer class or variable have same ids,in case the values are same?
what happens when we compare two objects with == operator??
why pass is taken?
Excellent
Can we create class with using a multiple functions
Sir in the last video you passed ram and CPU as 2 parameters.............y didn&#39;t you pass cpu/ram as self and the other one as ram/cpu itself?
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
When do we use self as a parameter of a function in class?
your explanations are too good, damn!
how many type of constructor in python
What is mean by instance varible
hey navin, please make and upload the real time and project which is being used in industry for python
I was unable to understand constructors for very long time..now it seems clearer...thanka
hi, can you please briefly describe self in python. Did not understand
Thanks
Short &amp; Crispy!!
How do I get on Th e click documentation access ?
Which editor you are using
Your videos is very knowledgeable sir.<br>Can we use self 2 times in compare method?
Thank you sir.
best tutor on youtube.<br>one request can you please upload or teach live projects on python
You speak too fast most of the times, like you are in a hurry or like we don&#39;t have much time to watch the videos. What&#39;s more, in almost all videos there are unnecessary cuts and additions every second which are overwhelming and distracting. I can&#39;t help losing focus somewhere in most videos, yet I keep watching to see the content as there may be some important tips and tricks that other channels may forget to mention.
you are the best sir
Omg! Love the way you explain!!! Never felt this good after watching any python tutorial.
Hello Navin, thank you for wonderful training in Python. It is helping me a lot.<br>I have a question, when we are writing functions and calling them , why do we need to create class and object? OOPs concept is always confusing to me :)
seems like &#39;self&#39; is same as  &#39;this pointer&#39; in c++ , but we put it as first parameter in python.
Hello dear sir....<br>I like the way you teach and thank you so much for clearing our concept like that. Dear sir can we say that self is similar to this keyword in java or C++ ?
Thank you so much for your videos. They make learning easy. I am an amateur programmer but always struggled with the &quot;self&quot; concept. Finally a instructor who can explain it well. Subscribed to your channel.
Didn&#39;t get it 😞
but why is it necessary to write self in c1.update(self) even though we have written c1
As we are mentioning c1.update() it points to c1 why it will points to the c2 object
I used to hate OOPs, but now I changed my mind just because of you sir.<br>Keep up the good work. You&#39;re the best.
another awesome video. great. thank you.
Bro,while comparing what can we do if there are more than two objects ?
I was literally confused what does self do by watching ur video my confusion got cleared.Thank for explaining so well.
wtf?
Salute you bro
When we write the def <i>_init__(self): funtion, I found by practice that space before __init_</i> is very important. Have you any guys encountered this ( silly, me) bug?? :)
Nice explanation<br>Love you ❤ sir
You missed CC here__
Sir please start dsa course <br>We are all waiting sir pls <br>It will be very much helpful for us^_^
# I&#39;ve made a code using a manual method def_var() to define variables of an object<br># I didn&#39;t use __init__() but I had to call def_var() explicitly<br># It runs successfully<br># Can I call it my own constructor?

Great supebb
Thank you man

You said it perfectly in two words, it is the &quot;current instance.&quot; That helps me visualize it better now than I could before. Thank you.
tq
So, we can say that self is like &quot;this&quot; in java
My bad ❤️
Watched many videos and just your 1 video made all my concepts clear.. so thankful to u!!!
I liked the approach you lectured the concept. It is good. It helped me to understand. Thank you.
That compare method gives a good explanation about self. Thanks for explaining.
Really like your video, helped me alot...its just you speak too fast, sometimes some points are missed, we need to watch video again and again to understand.
It&#39;s useful
Why keeping the class empty shows indentation error, when we print the address?
when should self not be used?
bro i was looking for this comparing everywbere! Thanks for the help!
&quot;Self&quot; works like a &quot;this&quot; keyword in java.
Thank you for this video! You saved my life :D
Sir want to strong base of software development what to do ? Like how memory works and every basic concepts whats going behind the scene please guide 🙏
you are the best tutor in india
My address of an object is about a 13 digit address.
god bless you and your dear ones navin sir
Thank u so much...its extremely good..
The videos are far better than any course.learnt a lot
Aliens?
What if user tries to add as many as ages he / she wants? How to create a code to create new variables that passes into a constructor?

my brain: what exactly is self?<br>me watching this video: shut the f*** up<br><br>this dude is awesome...... i mean an alien
Cant we have multiple constructors like java like parameterised and default constructor both. BDW brilliant content u should have this series updated in Udemy
Hello Navin,<br>I want to define one function and want to pass external variable in the function and want change its value inside the function. <br>how can I do that ?<br>suggestion
Awesome explanation
Perfect, but one thing I don&#39;t like. You should not hide parts of code while you explaining, it is hard to follow this way
self works  similar to this pointer in oops right ?
Thank you!!
i&#39;m going to teach python to NGO kids, but I was not sure how to make them understand. your videos are helping me the way to teach anybody. you make programming looks so easy!!!! but don&#39;t tell me you are just 28

Such a great tutor!
same like java we can access static variables using class name...........
Really good 👍
sir when we create a static variable and manipulate it by using object then what will happen internally? and shall it affects the another object of the same class?
sir when we create a static variable and manipulate it by using object then what will happen internally? and shall it affects the another object of the same class? can you please explain that in some more details?
This is the video I&#39;ve been looking for a long time, Thanks Sir
AttributeError: &#39;Car&#39; object has no attribute &#39;com&#39;<br><br><br><br>Hello sir i am getting this error can you please explain what to do and explain the reason why this error i get
u are the best teacher ever
We have two types of variables<br>1. Class variables or Static variables - (e.g. wheels) - which are stored in the class namespace <br>2. Instance variables - (e.g. com, mil) - which are stored in instance namespace
thank you so much omg this is perfect for understanding class/static variables in python!
but sir we have already assign change wheel value in object like p1.wheel = 6 it will not change value by assigning car.wheel value
HEYYYY Navin you are ossum.... thanks for each python video....
sir<br>thank you very much for your effort <br>i was very new to these <br>since your explanation is very clear, i am able to understand very easily<br>i am very happy that you are teaching these for free
So good tutorial
you are a great teacher thank you keep going
What is the difference between class variables and global variables?
i don&#39;t know how can i express my love for this man😍😍😘😘😘😘
But actually there are three types of variables<br>1. Instance variable<br>2. Static(class variable)<br>3.Local variable
hello guys i have one question i was following whole tutorial till this episode but i have observed that till previously everything we typed was small case and now Navin sir is using first letter as upper cases while defining the class so is there any specific reason or something???
But, what if we change wheels of C1 alone by typing C1.wheels=5 for instance? <br><br> will it affects class variable wheels in all objects or not?
class variables cam be changed for particular instances i think you forgot to tell this..
Oh WOW...!!
Hi Navin. What do you say ? Python should not let us change class variables data using object. And if so then, it should change for all existing objects, thats how meaningful concept of class variables comes into play. C++ has no instanced variables concept for this reason only.  Abstraction should be same for all instances i.e. interface box should be same.
i fckn love you, thats the teaching
bye-bye that I feel this never end the python language
When I give c1. wheels=5 it still changes...
Hmm it seems like static in java...
Using object name also we can change the static variables I.e. instead of car.wheels we can use c1.wheels and the value gets updated!!! Please explain
in your previous videos you said that objects store in heap memory and here you saying that object store in namespace. namespace and heap memory are same or they are different.
Even You can change Class variables using  object.But It will affect variables of that object
What is local variable ???
legendary Sir ji
we can still have two different values of wheels if we use object names instead of class name. please resolve my query
i am getting attribute error pls anyone help me
thank you random indian man for letting me survive this years ict class
what is local variable means???, how to declare???
Sir please tell us how did you edit your videos with such animation<br>Please sir<br>If possible then try to make a separate video on it. Its a humble request for your subscribers
ye hamare sir h, ye unki car h ,aur ye hamari padhai ho rahi h
Class/Static Variables = GLOBAL VARIABLES<br>Instance Variables = LOCAL VARIABLES.
What if while updating we put c1 instead of car? Please tell me sir..
Great constructor you Are sir😍🔥
Thank You sir....❤️
But c1.wheels=5 is also working.
thank you
What a teacher he is it just amazing
is there any software that can show output in the form of boxes like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSQjxL5WRNM&amp;t=1m08s"">1:08</a> in the video tutorial!<br>This question needs a reply<br>please reply
Thanks for teaching about types of variable
Nice sir
This sometimes happens with some cars hahah :D. PS. Your classes are the best !<br>Regards!
Thank you so much for all your vedios, those are very useful. But im expecting theory notes from you. Practical part everything is fine.
Mr.Navin how can i make a real projects with python , can you provide me websites that i can improve my skills
can we change the value of class variable for a particular object?
Superb explanation Sir
Instance variable can only change the value of wheels for themselves whereas class can change for all of them
hello sir<br>if u telling the particular  topic pls tell us what are the applications abd few examples by using  the topic<br>and we can undestand quickly about the  topic and we can think about it
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSQjxL5WRNM&amp;t=4m26s"">4:26</a> , what if i put c1.wheels = 5 instead of car.wheels=5...????
Good audio quality<br>Good graphics<br>Good explanation skills<br>😉 These are the things that many videos in the youtube lack<br>And hence they are inconvenient<br>But welcome to telusko learnings where these are satisfied
Hi Navin,<br><br>This class and instance variable is very much clear. But can u please explain me the below code and it is working fine also.<br>class car():<br>    wheel = 4<br>    def __init__(self):<br>        self.mil=10<br>        self.name=&quot;BMW&quot;<br><br>c1=car()<br>c2=car()<br>c1.wheel=5<br>print(<a href=""http://c1.mil/"">c1.mil</a>,<a href=""http://c1.name/"">c1.name</a>,c1.wheel)<br>print(<a href=""http://c2.mil/"">c2.mil</a>,<a href=""http://c2.name/"">c2.name</a>,c2.wheel)<br><br>Output:<br>10 BMW 5<br>10 BMW 4
coming after going by c c++ java , we know that static variables will change even when changed using their object name , here if c1.wheels is used than value for both wont get changed ,, again python amazed me ?? @Telusko help
i m getting attribute error whilw i m doing exactly same, please telusko sir help me
sir if i use c1.wheel , it change  wheel for c1 only .. and  if i use car.wheel it changes for two objects .   Is this due to  new update of python ? ?
Congrats for being 1M+ Subscribers.... This is the proof of your quality teaching. Keep it up. Thanks a lot...💖💖💖💖
Great sir Thanks a lot
Congrats for 1M subscribers
Really u r a legend ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Well Explained Mr. Navin. And as usual :). <br>May be worth also, explaining the importance of &quot;modifying class variables with class names only&quot; and  contrasting the effect of &quot;modifying class variables with object names&quot;.
This right side explanation makes it more clear and easy to understand
hi sir, hope you are doing good and staying fit and healthy. I really love your teaching . I have a question. Here I am accessing the static variable outside the class using class name. But when I am trying to change the value of the static variable outside the class using object name it is changing the value of wheel for both the objects. For eg, c1=Car()<br><br>c2=Car()<br><br>c1.company=&#39;Toyota&#39;<br><br>c2.wheels=7<br><br>print(<a href=""http://c1.company/"">c1.company</a>,c1.mileage,c1.wheels)<br><br>print(<a href=""http://c2.company/"">c2.company</a>,c2.mileage,c2.wheels) <br><br>This code should give error right ?!! but instead it is changing the value of wheel for the objects. Kindly clear out my confusion. Thank you sir and always stay blessed.
How does namespace differ from heap memory? How do they fit together in the grander scheme of memory/space?
Your content and way of teaching is really amazing,your the best teacher I have seen till now in terms of programming,A BIG THANK YOU!✨
Sir, I got an error invalid syntax.
civil engineer learning python..:) :).. thanks for making it interesting and simple..
c1.wheels=3<br><br>will it print wrong😕
And if we change the value for a instance variable using class name then the value for all  the object variables changes
BUT sir if instead of using class name to update the class variable if we use the object name then only for that object the value of class variable changes
if i do c1.wheels =5 then it will change only for c1 object and not for c2. they how we can say that it is different from instance variable?
Assign a new value to class variable like c1.wheels = 6, it behalves like instant variable, Please explain.
the  more videos i watch the more amazed i get thank you so much sir
Hi Navin , you are the best tutor . However from the OOP video onwards , I am a little lost and I know its because I am unable to relate , you are still superb. I come from a non technical back ground. Is there any other good reading material that you can refer me back to, just to understand the fundamental/basic of the OOP. Tried many other  websites but no one is even close to you. So thought of checking with you directly
But if i change c1.wheel = 6 then only c1.wheel value is changed but c2.wheel remain 4
instead of defining compare can we use<br>if c1.age==c2.age &amp; c1.name==<a href=""http://c2.name/"">c2.name</a><br>instead of<br>defining in compare with self and other argument?
why cant we just print out the data instead of writing functions and putting variabls??
Hi, I used the same code but still got some error but not sure the reason. Can anyone help? Error is <br>    com1 = Computer(&#39;15gb&#39;, 16)<br>TypeError: Computer() takes no arguments
so simple!!
while x == 1<br>  print(&#39;you are best&#39;)
Naveen.....You are awesome....
What is local variable ??
Can&#39;t, we change the static variable using the objects
its like local and global variable???
for i in range(1,100):<br>     print(&quot;First class teacher  in world&quot;)
I face a attribute error whenever i run this code for the given example. can you please helo me resolve my issue.
but we can change the value of the class variable for an object<br>c1.wheels=3<br>print(c1.wheels) gives 3<br>print(c2.wheels) gives 4
Hello Sir your explanation about each topic is so good, but I have a problem regarding class variable. I&#39;m not defining any class variable inside a class but whenever I access it like <br>car.wheels = 3<br>print(car.wheels)<br>it&#39;s printing it..and I don&#39;t know why and how..
Sir is Else a valid variable
Graphics in the  video makes it very easier to understand
What happen if we gave a variable out the class
Class carro ():<br>     Def __init__(self):<br>           self.mil=input  (&quot;informe: &quot;)<br>           self.com=input (&quot;informe: &quot;)<br><br>Cl1=carro ()<br>Cl2=carro ()<br><br>Cl1.mil=8<br><br>Print (<a href=""http://cl1.com/"">Cl1.com</a>, Cl2.mil)
sir if i want to use variable wheels in function of class then how should i use it.

I tried using self in place of cls in info . It’s working fine, So what’s the big difference between using cls and self.
Do everyone a favour and stop doing utube vids - you are entirely incomprehensible
THis is really &quot;class&quot; video
👍
it&#39;s been 4 years, in Newer version we don&#39;t have to use<br>@classmethod
sir the letures are awesome but ur too fast abt   working of the program (means how the self refers to object and some key points u r so fast <br>explain the things in slow way(not too slow) that would be understanding for many others<br>and ur teaching is just awesome the above point is the only thing and thats not ur fault but i didnt understand the working <br>so i am just telling u there are so many people like me who feels the same <br>so plzz look into that sir
one in a million time coincidence  wow!!!!🤣🤣
thanku
I still don’t understand what is the use of learning this language. What is this trying to explain in real life?
sir, if we dont want to hardcode the variable values of an inner class. Can we create the object of inner class simultaneously while creating the object of outer class. For example If I wnat to add the data of the student s1&#39;s laptop while creating the object s1 is it possible if yes how t9o do it.
Help!!<br>class students:<br>    school=&quot;vidyodaya&quot;<br>    def __init__(self,m1,m2,m3):<br>        self.m1=m1<br>        self.m2=m2<br>        self.m3=m3<br>    def average(self):<br>        return (self.m1+self.m2+self.m3)/3<br><br>    def get_m1(self):<br>        return self.m1<br>    def set_m1(self,value):<br>        self.m1=value<br>s1=students(23,45,67)<br>a1=s1.average()<br>print(&quot;avg is : &quot;,int(a1))<br>print(s1.m1,s1.m2,s1.m3,students.school)<br>print(s1.get_m1())<br>n1=s1.set_m1(90)<br>print(n1)<br><br><br>what iam doing wrong iam not getting new valuse of m1,it giving output as none<br><br>can someone help plz.....
This concept was confusing and I couldn&#39;t understand. Thanks to your clear and simple explanation. ur amazing. Now I am very clear with types of methods. I refer your tutorial any python concept that doesn&#39;t go into my brain. once again Thanks to you!
you talk very fast i barely hear you work on that!!
Tbh this video was very confusing
u r fast
Hi! It&#39;s been 4 years since this video was uploaded and still, its veryyyyy useful. I failed to understand this concept but you made me understand it in a matter of a few minutes! This means a lot to me. Thanks...
Tq you
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVfGQOzzRCM&amp;t=4m44s"">4:44</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 amizing man different random numbers happen to have the same average
😬even I got the same average as you for s1
what did you say?
i dont understand set_m1 and get_m1 methods
Can you explain why a.sort() returns None for a list a, but a.values() doesn&#39;t return None if a is a dictionary. Both dictionaries and lists are mutable (and if mutable, are modified in place, right?). So why is a method such as sort on a list void whereas a method on a dictionary not void (and can be assigned to another variable, printed etc). Any help would be great because right now I have no clear appreciation between mutability, modifying in place and returning None . Thanks
I need more into Python to understand from this point. You are quick and to the point!
Why did you change the s1 number when you are writing the s2
can you give more examples of static method Mr. Naveen
Thanks man 👍🏻
Is there a private variable concept in python?
Hi the get_m1 and set_m2 are not working for me, I have copied the exact code as on the screen but I am getting the variable address all the time.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVfGQOzzRCM&amp;t=4m30s"">4:30</a> what the .... 😲😲 😲
This is a very nice video, I have once been stuck due to insufficient knowledge of python method types
My python is not like this that is black in colour pls tell how to download this
So Great honestly!
What are the method of thread class  <br>How to write this question and what things should be included
It works even if we don&#39;t use @staticmethod
Bhai Hindi mein bologe toh kya hoga
Why am I a alien ??!!!!!
I had promised myself that I will not like and comment any youtube channel , but I couldn;t resist myself , @Naveen you are gem , I wish I could find your channel years before. But anyway I am learning python like pro. Thank you so much for creating such playlist.
can we use if else statements in methods
Some one noticed MOLUDE @10.30  😋😛
Python for beginners, right
Call us as a Aliens boosts up our Energy and by listening it we feel like focus..!
Plz explain get method in dictionaries
sir, The interviewer asks me is static method can be overiden
nice video but little fast....
Thank you for such a nice tutorial ! :))
That was a lot of new things.
Thank you so much sir
amazeing teaching sir 🙌🙌
Thank u anna .  now I got clear idea of instance and class method
Hello Sir, Can you please explain these outputs to me ?<br><br><br>txt = &quot;bacc acc abcc&quot;<br>print (txt.split(&quot;c&quot;))<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>Output:<br>&quot;ba&quot; , &quot;&quot; , &quot; a&quot; , &quot;&quot; , &quot; ab&quot; , &quot;&quot; , &quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>listtobejoined = [ &quot;ba&quot; , &quot;&quot; , &quot; a&quot; , &quot;&quot; , &quot; ab&quot; , &quot;&quot; , &quot;&quot; ]<br>separator = &quot;c&quot;<br>print (separator.join(listtobejoined))<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>Output:<br>&quot;bacc acc abcc&quot;<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;
great great great
You made me sir thanks!!!
why do we don&#39;t use lambda in OPPs
Your presentation and teaching skill is just top-level...
Thank you Mr. Reddy!
😂i don&#39;t know why the same coincidence happened with me also,<br>i got avarage as 7.333333333333 with random numbers😂
without useing @staticmethod decoreter still it perform... why
everything is perfect. but, I don&#39;t know why you go fast ?
You missed CC
How to print the set_m1 function
Oh!Hold on<br> (◔‿◔)
Navin, Dont confuse between variables and methods by saying in this video.
# They are different types of method in the class<br># class methods and instance/object method and static method<br><br>class student:<br><br>    school =&quot;SK Base&quot;<br><br>    def __init__(self,m1,m2,m3):<br>        self.m1 = m1<br>        self.m2 = m2<br>        self.m3 = m3<br><br>    # This instance method belongs to each object of class<br>    def avg(self):<br>        return (self.m1+self.m2+self.m3)/3<br><br>    <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23creating"">#creating</a> class method and we need to externall mention that<br>    @classmethod<br>    def get_school(cls):<br>        print(cls.school)<br><br>s1 = student(45,66,96)<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23s2"">#s2</a> = student(35,56,44)<br><br>print(s1.avg())<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23print"">#print</a>(s2.avg())<br>print(student.get_school())<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23we"">#we</a> required average mark of each student
My friend also selected in infosys after watching ur videos and so i came here to watch your videos and i am better in coding now after watching videos
Sir your videos are excellent and no words to say and i am final year student. Can anoyone explain me why we  use oops concept and what is use of it ? Will we use functions instead of this ?
what a coincidence!! at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVfGQOzzRCM&amp;t=4m35s"">4:35</a>
If we have created 2 objects for a class and change the class variable of one of the objects, it is not affecting the other one while printing. Only if we change the class variable using the class, it changes for every object.
Thanks for good lectures, nice video editing, less time and teaching more.
does this guy now telugu
@Telusko
Can we get the marks as a input from the user @Telusko
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVfGQOzzRCM&amp;t=11m00s"">11:00</a>: Guess is <b>@staticmethod</b> decorator.
Your Teaching Techniques are very short and crisp and to the point......seriously my concepts are clear about python language because of you sir....thank you so much for that...
I=0<br>While I&lt;3:<br>    Print(&quot;Thanks telusko&quot;)
We all want telusko university
Clear and concise ! Thx for this :)
Accessor methods or Getters in Python = Pure Functions in Java.<br>Mutator methods or Setters in Python = Impure Functions in Java.
tq
U r really a true talented man🔥🔥 the way of explaining something is just awesome sir
Why we use decorators here to (like @classmethod ) above the methods
Hi brother, this was another amazing video, I would like to ask you about something you can help me with, what is your advice to someone who is looking for a job as a full-stack software developer, I know python very well, but I am looking for real life projects to implement what I have learned the programming in python, do you know books or web sits with end to end projects??<br>The second thing is where is the web sits to learn java script, and after learning it again i will ask for real life end to end projects, even the courses with money, but I like to see myself as a developer as soon as possible. Many thanks for the great job you are doing <br>Mustafa
Sir, What about multiple parameterize  Constructor..?
Thank you Navin!
Excellent 🙏
dear sir, what is the programme if i wanted to print all averages at a time , with out  repeatedly using print for all objects  (LIKE PRINT(A1.AVG()))  ? imagine i have  100 objects that i want to have average  for !
Till now in Telusko journey, this is the FIRST Video I Enjoyed a lot by Understanding various methods and printing way of those and placement of variables.
Add videos on data structures also
first i learnt class methon from code with harry i get confused but thank you , you made my concepts very clear
sir pls explain types of method once again
sir as you say static variables are class variables, so can we change a class variable value in static methods? like we do in class methods
Please make blogs with YouTube video content
I am bit confuse if we can change instance and class varibles directly then why it is needed to use methods
Thank you, nice brief information. i would really appreciate if you can slowdown little while explaining..  it seems you are hurrying for some reason . a suggestion.
is this english??
Telusko University. Sounds good.
Thnk you so much for this tutorial!!! wenever i wanna understand any concept first thing i will do is to look out for ur video. surprisingly this is the oly channel on youtube wherein i can watch it without drowsing.
He is not understandable
sir i dont reuire @staticmethod decorator in my program but it was working fine
b&#39;bye
you speak way too fast!"

hi, <br>is it possible to access methods of inner class by creating an object of inner class outside the outer class.
I am wondering how much clarity that you have in your concept, otherwise we can&#39;t get this much stuff. As a lecturer I can see your work behind this video
getting error <br><br><br>&quot; student() takes no arguement &quot;<br><br>constantly in every video of this class. <br><br><br>how to resolve?
I&#39;ve seriously become better at coding as I use these tutorial to shift from Java to Python!
Sir I am creating a two instance method of sum and avg in the average method I am getting error in it
you are just  a flame sir g
Best videos and better than paid courses
Thank for your video
Keeps getting more confusing.  Hope I can figure this out.
confusing and not working
Student of Telusko ?
Sir, my doubt is if we take user inputs for laptop class at outside the student class ilke<br>lap1=student.laptop(&#39;HP&#39;, &#39;i5&#39;, &#39;8gb&#39;) <br>lap2=student.laptop(&#39;intel&#39;, &#39;i10&#39;, &#39;16gb&#39;) <br>We create a show function also for laptop class then show can we call thatshow function in student show function? <br>      We can call individually or at a time..... <br>Them how we can call ? Please calrify my doubt sir.....
Is it possible to add two numbers, without passing anything from the user outside the class, just by using the <i>_init_</i> method?
I have a doubt with the first process: what i am trying to achieve is the Laptop classes variables are also given by user how to achieve that with the first way you have shown ? with the second way I have successfully taken the values from user.
really a great great way teaching these type of methods
i didnt <a href=""http://understand.you/"">understand.you</a> were too fast
can we give user input in inner class?
thnaku sir you are amazing

Nice sir
why self.lap=self.laptop() is written in line 6???<br>can any body help me?
self.m1 + self.m2 + self.m3
Why didn&#39;t we write the variables in &#39;init&#39; of the inner class. As per assigning the variables, it should be written like,<br>def __init__(self, brand, ram).<br>But why didn&#39;t he mention that there.
Hold on, That&#39;s Weird and My Bad
sir why u have taken delf show(self):

Hi sir,<br>       Ni am Debanjan Das . I have faced a problem regarding inner class and I drives a code that will not nun yet . Can you help me sir????
cant we use user input inside the class
Great
Just awesome
Sir could you explain how u take argument in Student , as Student is class not a method..
Confusing
(Siddesh): Thank you sp much Navin.
can we make two constructors as we do in other progg. lang. one constrict. take some argument and other constrict takes no argument??<br>Please help
Sir, When we create a object of inner class, OUTSIDE outer class and keep some changes in its variable by this object. Then after accessing that variable by the object of inner class created INSIDE outer class, it can not changes its variable&#39;s value...... Why??
How to change student two laptop information ?? Please anyone can help
It would be better if you have added any exercise  at the end of the video
sir ur tuts are love.. in this lockdown
If you want a different example of inner class; here it is <br>class geometry:<br>    def __init__(self):<br>        self.rectangle = self.rectangle()<br>        self.triangle = self.triangle()<br><br>    class rectangle:<br>        def __init__(self):<br>            self.l = int(input(&quot;Enter length:&quot;))<br>            self.b = int(input(&quot;Enter breadth:&quot;))<br>        def show(self):<br>            area = self.l * self.b<br>            print(&quot;The area of rectangle is:&quot;,area)<br><br>    class triangle:<br>        def __init__(self):<br>            self.h = int(input(&quot;Enter height:&quot;))<br>            self.b = int(input(&quot;Enter base:&quot;))<br><br>        def show(self):<br>            area = 0.5 * self.b * self.h<br>            print(&quot;The area of triangle  is:&quot;,area)<br><br>r1 = geometry.rectangle()<br>r1.show()<br>t1 = geometry.triangle()<br>t1.show()
Sir, can you please tell me how we can pass input taken by the user to the object of inner class
sir ye video to bilkul bhi samaj nhi aayi <br>can u can a simple version of this video ...plz
Sir ye confusing h smg nhi aaya 2 bar dekha video pls explain
Sir can you please explain regarding creating object of inner class??<br>and explain again regarding:<br>self.lap=self.Laptop()<br>and<br>self.lap.show()
why didn&#39;t we use self,cpu,ram in laptop class
Why is it necessary to define object of inner class in the init of outer class?
Holy crap these are amazing quality and very well produced. The audio was good, the camera nice, It was well lit, and the little animated graphics were a nice touch and of good quality as well. This goes far beyond any typical Youtube tutorial on these kinds of topics.<br>Thank you so much for paying attention to these kinds of details. They mean so much more than most people know. Thank you so much.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JzgybKvys&amp;t=6m23s"">6:23</a> lol
What if I want to ask the user to enter the values for ram , cpu and brand.<br>I mean I don&#39;t want to enter values within the program , then how can I do it. Please reply sir
❤
Sir<br>Pls upload a video of tkinter in python🙏
why don&#39;t you upload the notes of python course in your website
Sir please give us a project with python, because I am a engineering student (IT),so make the videos for a project.
class Student:<br>    def __init__(self):<br>        <a href=""http://self.name/"">self.name</a><br>        self.roll<br>    def setdata(self,name,roll):<br>        self.name=name<br>        self.roll=roll<br>    def showdata(self):<br>        print(<a href=""http://self.name/"">self.name</a>,self.roll)<br>s1=Student()<br>s1.setdata(&quot;mohit&quot;,71)<br>s1.showdata()<br><br><br>please, anyone tell me what is wrong with this code .... I tried to assign the values in setdata method rather than init method.
Why we have to use self. Laptop().

Sir! Can I have ur Instagram I&#39;d name? Sir
thanks for your hard work for us.bcos of ur effort we able to learn python
sir how do we pass data to inner class through objects of the outer class?
navin ji, is there any way of get more example of this video ?
if we don&#39;t provide any decorator and call method using ClassName it still works. So why to have decorator ????. e.g method is just printing random string.
where we are declaring the lap key word
phenomenal videos!
I love the way of presentation
thank you sir.........
Sir I have a doubt, what if we want a parameterized constructor in inner class then how to call it and execute it? I tried it but I am getting error inside outer class constructor. Please help me out sir."

man the editing and the way you explain this whole thing is just wow man i can  see the dedication hats off
Thank you so much.. I wanted to say this right after the energetic intro of yours
Tq sir🙏🙏🙏
Sir, where were u ? really explained in minutes.........
Clear cut explanation
Fuckin ads
I sucked at programming as a Mechanical Engineer. But now, when I have completed 55 Python lectures, I feel confident as I know my knowledge on fundamentals have improved over time. I know I was little late to this free python course, but thank you Meha for suggesting this best beginner course. Thank you Navin sir and Telusko Team
A big thanks 😊
Can  inner class and inheritance perform same tasks I&#39;ve really confused both
tremendous sir
Awesome example love it
That was very simple and useful ! Thank you
Best explanation of class inheritance, thanks a ton!
Thank you very much
Thanks✌
Quick, simple, and clear 👍
A perfect lecture
Thank you sir
U made it look so simple thank you
I watch multiple videos on inheritance but you made it cup of tea for me.☺
Your video is very good but class names and object names you had used are very confusing...you should use a practical analogy instead
Crystal clear explanation , thanks Navin Reddy sir.
Tq
Thank You
This is one of the simplest explanation of inheritance I have come across. The way multi-level and multiple inheritance have been explained is simply awesome.
what about diamond problem when a class does multiple inheritance ?
my loving and beautiful ,wife!!! i miss youuu
This can&#39;t get more simpler
very very helpful..
You are an amazing explainer
you got a new sub 🙂
Sir what if I want feature 5 in class A or Class B.
noice
From this month i am a big fan of you sir❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💞💞💞
Very good and precise way of explaining a relatively tough concept. Your pace of explanation and examples are really good.
THIS  GUY  IS THE GOD OF EXPLANATIONS
the way u taught  is  fab!!!!
God bless u Alien.....🍉
This may be a common scense. But I would like to mention it here.<br>If you want to do Inheritance successfully, the Super Class must come before (or above) Sub Class in the code. You can&#39;t call a class which is typed below. These are very big lessons for me as I am a total newcomer to Python.<br>I am thoroughly enjoying my ride through this playlist from the very first video, two thumbs up!!!
Good video... Most other tutorials teach from too much existing code and it can get confusing. You kept it super simple that it was easy to understand. I&#39;m subbing. Thanks.
You are a brilliant and amazing teacher. Thanks
class Parent:<br>    x=1<br>class Child1(Parent):<br>    pass<br>class Child2(Child1):<br>    pass<br>print(Parent.x,Child1.x,Child2.x)<br>Child1.x=2<br>print(Parent.x, Child1.x, Child2.x)<br>Parent.x=3<br>print(Parent.x,Child1.x,Child2.x)<br>Can you please explain the output for this!
Thanks 👍👍
explained very well
Who else’s example dint print the the first code?
Haven&#39;t seen anyone explain python programming as simple as you do....Thank you sir
Shahzada😘💖
Anyone knows the differences between attributes and instance ?<br>I watched the video but didn&#39;t understand
Great sir g,
your intro music is too long might want to shorten it down to half its length.
Wow❤️❤️❤️❤️
EXCELLENT  explanation. Thx a lot
This was very well taought indeed; hanks a ton for sharing this!
You are the best!
Hi sir, I want linked list in python can I get that, when I will join this channel.just I want to know.
Thankyou man! This is really helpful
If this works why do I need Super?
Good sir thanks
it mean i can use functions form another class, but how can we send data form this class to another class and then take other data from that class back
What is bl &amp; al <br>Can I change it ?
Currently i am placed . Your videos have a big role in my achievement. It makes me more confident and improves programming skill
java doesnt support multiple inheritence because if both parent class has methods with same name then if child calls it there will be ambiguity ......... but python seems to support multiple inheritence ????
I learned more in about 7 minutes than my 2 hour uni lecture about the same topic...<br>Great content sir hats off to you, keep it up!
woooooooooooooooowww...........simply amazing
great explanation sir as usual
Super
Extraordinary explanation, without having a programming background, I could easily grasp fundamentals.
This is quite impressive explanation sir.<br>Thanks a lot for this.
Bro in this program can u run this program at once and show us output please
Can u create python playlist in your youtube channel in which I want to learn all about python programming please.
I will give you rating 10 out of 10.
last vedio a bit confused<br>this one &quot;man so easy&quot;<br>thank you sir
Best online python tutor
THERE COULDN&#39;T HAVE BEEN MORE EASILY EXPLAINED VIDEO ON INHERITENCE
Great u r great because I read books and nowhere found this simplicity.😀 . Simplicity has its own greatness.
Can you also come up with tutorials about ethical hacking?<br>I wanna do it later and i heard python is very good for that, besides, i dont know a better teacher in programming than you!
being a chemical engineer and learning python in covid times one thing i can say is that this is one of the best series on python and every lecture is made so simple just because of ur efforts sir. <br>thanks reddy sir
what an absolute chad! thank you so much your videos are amazing!
tq
well explained , nice examples, easy to understand...
your lectures are so wonderful but i also want to learn python turtle so please make series.
Wow All  ganjy are awesome
A man with lot of stuff....... Like you broo...!
And your videos are really helping me a lot
Sir plss give some notes to remember the concepts you taught
I am learning python but the way he explained inheritance no one does. To the point and perfectly explained😍😍😍😍😍😍.
Crystal clear explanation
I can say you completely didn&#39;t waste  our time .....you are Great
wow wow wow wow just wow .  Perfect tutorial !! Sir ,.. Thank You Sir
really simple and helpful ! Thank you so much !!
what is (self) here, can we write a function without using self in the ()
a little to basic.  why can&#39;t i inherit classes when the order is switched?
how to use <i>_init_</i> variables from both parent classes while doing multiple inheritance?
Very well explained. Thanks!
Excellent Video. Tq
best python Inheritance tutorial <br>Thank you
&quot;My parents&#39; phone is my phone but my phone is my phone&quot; XD.<br>I guess I am not the only one haha
You make Python really easy, Thanks Navin
nice, short and efficient explanation my friend. i liked .
I think you are going very fast. I watch your video at .75 speed :(   Thanks for your effort"

Super teaching
Excuse me, but __init__() is not a constructor. Infact python do not have any constructor 🙂 so call it as init as it is, calling it as constructor is Wrong.
Am just loving your channel ❤️
Please I didn&#39;t get your name
Thank you for this. I am back here after so many days just to say thanks... So I had learnt python from this playlist in lockdown, and I am so grateful that I did it. I must say this has helped a lot. Lots of thanks for such videos ☺
iam become big fan sir
U are amazing sir thank you for this
what if I want to initialize both superclass?
you are the besttttttttttt dear sir
Sir I have made a one class as student and and get the sum in student class <br>Then I had create one more class of result and I want avg of the student class sum but it is giving error to us
Very good
sir why the parents class constructor is not implicitly get called when  child is instantiated like in java or c++
In the case of duplicate methods between parent classes, using super() will not take any arguments to choose which to use, and will always go from left to right as you list them when defining the child class.<br>ie. C(A, B) will pull from A in the case of duplicates, and C(B, A) will pull from B in the case of duplicates.<br><br>In the case of duplicate methods between parent classes, you can choose which of the parent classes to use a method from by explicitly calling the method within the child class. Instead of using super().method() you can decide which instance of the duplicate to use by naming it explicitly. If your class inherits A before B, like in C(A, B), but you want to use a method from B that also exists in A, use B.method() to use it.<br><br>super(). looks like a good shortcut for when you know you will not be dealing with choosing between duplicates, and you don&#39;t want to explicitly mention which class to call from.
When considering MRO, does it consider the name of the class? Does it sort according to the alphabetical order to find what is the first on the left?
Awesome, it was very interesting to understand and gain
Thanku
Best explanation ever spotted on python object oriented programming.  🙌  great job!! Keep posting
It&#39;s very nice vedio.<br>you are are saying that in multiple inheritance it follows the left to right <a href=""http://order.in/"">order.In</a> c(A,B) if we want to call any method from c in b then how to call.
How can we print inheritance of both super class at a time
Hello Navin sir, as mentioned &#39;C&#39; class is inherited with class &#39;A&#39; &amp; &#39;B&#39; then how to call class &#39;B&#39;s feature1() method from class &#39;C&#39; object. By default, it is calling class &#39;A&#39;s feature1() method &amp; found no option to call class &#39;B&#39; feature1() method. I know, there will be way to call this method, could you please let me know how to do that. Thanks !!
Awesome way of teaching
EXCELLENT. Thx alot
interesting if you type Class(B,A) instead of Class(B, A), the output is : In A init, In B init, In C init.
sir, i got a doubt here...according to MRO left to right it will work, what if need to get feature1() method from B class.
Thank you 🦋
enjoying
what if we want to access the  __init__( )  of class B using Super( )... is that possible ?
Great Video! Just one doubt. How do we know that &#39;A&#39; would be on the left and &#39;B&#39; on the right? Is it because we defined &#39;A&#39; first and then &#39;B&#39;?
what if we want to call right class INIT method
MRO - left to right then why here B&#39;s init not executed !!!!
Hello Sir<br><br>is their in no concept of access specifier (private ,protected and public) in python ??
Almost perfect. One question is left over: How can use access methods of B from class C(A, B) !!! I really insist on that question, because it will ruin all the reasoning behind the multiple inheritance...
My code gives en error when I change the class C&#39;s order B,A to A,B
All legends should be like this 😎😎
instead of defining class C(A,B) you call as  class C(B,A) to get the init of class B
Awesome Awesome Awesome
If Possible, Please conduct live session on python programming in this weekend Naveen sir.<br>It will very helpful to revise what we&#39;re learn.<br><br>Really, enjoy the session, clearly understand inheritance concepts -&gt; single-level, multi-level &amp; Multiple Inheritance<br>super() method usage, <i>_init_</i> constructor  and Method Resolution Order in inheritance.<br><br>Best python teacher ever in my life.<br>anyone want to do python crash course with-in 1 month, it is very helpful.<br><br>I have storage testing background,  this course very helpfully for my career.    All of my colleagues are fan of you sir.
very well explained. thank you !
Your energy in voice never let&#39;s me zone out of the session, you&#39;re amazing! thanks
Sir , in my system MRO isn&#39;t working
tq
We can use sub.__init__method(): in inheritance like super.__init__method()
Sir why no assignments 😔
make series on python turtle
Please start flask course
Great video. I have a question though... when you say MRO is left to right, is this because the call to Class(A,B) reads A first (as it is on left)... if we swap them around to Class(B,A) will it pick B first? Or is there some other abstract thing at play here... order of top to bottom? What if we swapped Class A and Class B around, so Class B was at the top?
Thanks a lot
This is the best best online course I have found till date. Best teacher Everrrrrrr
Sir I have a question what should we do if we want to call constructors of both super classes in subclass(in multiple inheritance).
english is my 3rd language so it&#39;s a bit harder for me to understand, but this guy explains it so good that im not having a hard time trying to understand what he says. what im trying to say is that i like this chanel and its better than payed courses.
Thank you very much , I am not able to understand this concept properly you help me made it. But I will also prefer to read python documentation to understand concept more properly after videos😊👌
As you told if we have multiple inheritance,it starts from left then,what if we want to access right method?
Thank you for your spoon feeding sir
How many types are there in inheritance sir ? because just now i found Hybrid Inheritance and Hierarchical Inheritance .
how to use init from both super classes?
Brother Navin I think your this video is INCOMPLETE, Bcos in Multiple Inheritance how to get Class B <i>_Init_</i> you did not show
thanks a lot sir !!!! This is Superb and amazing
who is disliking the video , I think now a days... donkey also watching the video....
Sir your teaching is just awesome
You had made most of the concepts super duper easy to learn. Really Thank you . Videos are really helpful. I love your way of teaching. God bless you.
Excellent explanation. Due to MRO, this is printing init of Class A, how to print init of class B without changing (A, B) to (B, A) in Class C and do not want to print class A init. (pls note that, adding super in each class, print init in for all classes, I am looking to print for Class B only)
Navin, could u pls explain how to call B&#39;s constructor here or any method in class B.
Navin, u r just amazing. Am really motivated to learn n teach like you. 👍😊
text is not clearly visible so difficult to understand
the funny line is when he said C is completely biased for B class
Sir, what if in MRO we want class B init in calling class C???
Excellent way of teaching. Thank you!
The best teacher I ever seen
What is the difference between super(B, self).__init__() and super().__init__() both are giving the same result
sir please up a series of python for intermediates so that it can help us in college, and making projects.
can somebody help me what is the meaning of this code?<br>print(&quot;%s %s&quot;%(color_list[0],color_list[-1]))
Then How to call Super().init of B class in Method Resolution Order
thankyou sir
Awsome sir
Great one, it also covers some disputed concepts of system verilog too....😄😄
Below black color sub titles are not allowing to see result.. Remaining all good
Thanks sir you are a very great teacher
In multiple inheritance what if we want to call method of B without calling A ...MRO says that A will be called first
Sir what if I need to print fearure1 at class B?how to do it
Very Good Sir
If we want call constructor of b using c&#39;s obj in multiple inheritance what is the condition we want apply?<br>Is we call super()._init_() again?
🖖🏻 Did you take that fron Sheldon Cooper?
I have a doubt.<br>What if we create one function in Class A and one function in Class B but with the same name.<br>now i inherit Class A in Class B and after creating an object for class B and want want to call that function but from class A.<br>For Example----<br>class A:<br>    def F1(self):<br><br>       print(&quot;I am Function 1 from Class A&quot;)<br>class B(A):<br>    def F1(self):<br>       print(&quot;I am Function 1 from Class B&quot;)<br>b = B()<br>b.F1()<br><br><br>Output will be &quot;I am Function 1 from Class B&quot;.<br><br><br>but i want to call function F1 from Class A.
What if we want to access both left and right methods from class C itself  ?
I have changed my google search on python to like multithreading in python telusko ... Ha ha I now add telusko in every python topic search ... Great lectures
Sir,refer @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P-P879BcHQ&amp;t=4m50s"">4:50</a> .When I code Iam told that &quot;type error&quot;,super() takes atleast one argument.<br>Why this happens??plz help.
Hello Navin instead of  super().__init__()  , we can you A(). any difference??
Twinkle twinkle little star 🌟 Navin sir python star 🌟
overall video is amazing and interesting too, but I found that whole tutorial becomes useless because of not having exercise problem.<br>especially for oops part.
Created account just to comment. Simple and to the point explanation.
subscrib done !
Sir when I was doing this programme output  is not coming ..It is written that &quot; Cannot create a consistence method resolution order for base A And B&quot; ...Help me plzzz
You look like satya Nadella 😅
What if we want to print <i>_init_</i> of B as well ?
This Is best
I had already watched other python tutorial but this guy he nails the knowlede in your brain also he teaches deep concepts
This concept became clear very easily
Sir super command is not working.<br>Super().__init__().<br>It says super has no argument
Plz explain,<br>class Animal: <br>def __init__(self, Animal): print(Animal, &#39;is an animal.&#39;) class Mammal(Animal):<br> def __init__(self, mammalName): print(mammalName, &#39;is a warm-blooded animal.&#39;) super().__init__(mammalName) <br>class NonWingedMammal(Mammal):<br> def __init__(self, NonWingedMammal):<br> print(NonWingedMammal, &quot;can&#39;t fly.&quot;) super().__init__(NonWingedMammal) class NonMarineMammal(Mammal): <br>def __init__(self, NonMarineMammal):<br> print(NonMarineMammal, &quot;can&#39;t swim.&quot;) super().__init__(NonMarineMammal) <br>class Dog(NonMarineMammal, NonWingedMammal): <br>def __init__(self): <br>print(&#39;Dog has 4 legs.&#39;) super().__init__(&#39;Dog&#39;) <br>d =Dog() <br>print(&#39;&#39;&quot;) <br>bat = NonMarineMammal(&#39;Bat&#39;)<br>...................................................<br>Plz explain this.

There is some ambiguity in this lecture . I couldn’t find Where and how exactly duck typing comes under polymorphism
memory only stores binary, 0 or 1
It feels so wrong that pycharm COMPILE and then run your code... :/
Amazing video hahaha, i really love how you educate the audiens, it&#39;s great
One of the best Explanations on Duck Typing 👍👌
All are saying that video is great concept clearing but i don&#39;t think that , i confuse in duck typing , what was he saying
Sir, please make one more video on duck typing. This video was too fast. Could nt get the concept. It would be great if u add one more video on the same.<br>thanks :D
only one word &quot;God&quot;
The same code is giving an error in VS Code. I think IDEs handle &#39;self&#39; differently.
Thanks aloooooot
ide is bit confusing take some other name
Great example, man!
Good tutorial.  Good speed too for someone who have some experience
Sir,what exactly ide.execute()  command does is it going to just execute the methods which we specify by class. Please clarify
haha did he just say &quot;welcome back aliens?&quot;
duck was cute
Amazing
thanks sir for a detailed knowledge❤
this can be easy more <br><br>class mobile:<br>    def games(self):<br>        print(&quot;chess&quot;)<br>        print(&quot;ludo&quot;)<br>class oppo:<br>    def camera(self):<br>        print(&quot;hd photos&quot;)<br>        print(&quot;hd videos&quot;)<br>class samsung():<br>    def brand(self,take):<br>        take.camera()<br><br>ob1=oppo()<br>ob2=samsung()<br>ob2.brand(ob1)
Thank you my man
If an object acts like a duck , then this is a duck.<br>If the object has the method  execute , that is an IDE .<br>Thanks sir  so much
It was a new concept for me and very nicely explained.
is execute is a keyword or you use it cause  you make a method def execute()????help!!!!
Telusko is great but Tbh this topic was bit confusing so PC Helper helped me understand this with ease.
Hello sir I got this class after seeing it 5 times everytime I missed one point that is that execute() method is the duck in the code🤦🤦 super sir
Thank you so much!
you are a horrible teacher with that fast talking temp of yours.
Sir your explanation was too fast that&#39;s why we couldn&#39;t understand
What is the need of inheritance? We can simply pass the object as parameters and get access to other class methods.
where is series 57
I DONT KNOW WHICH BASTARD GIVEN DUCK TYPING NAME, BCOS i dont think it has any relation with fucking DUCK 🤣🤣
@Telusko some of us can&#39;t understand this concept
Tq
please make series on python turtle
❤️❤️
really helpful
Then what&#39;s the difference between duck typing and inheritance?
Really awsm....fell in love with your videos and the way you teach....God bless u sir...
Initially I was confused with passing an object as an argument but later in the video, I got it❤️
need a refernce book
I love the editing
@29 sec ..when navin sir becomes a author 😂😂😂
I got this completely but still don&#39;t understand why they called this feature as a duck typing
Excellent explanation.
you always save my day!!  Thanking you!!
Now I have started enjoying python learning 😎😎😎😎😎
This is not clear sir ..I can&#39;t  understand  the logic in it
lets say something
One question?<br><br>If we have to mention &quot;ide&quot;  in the syntax, to execute the code..why have we not used &quot;ide&quot; for the codes in the videos previous to this one?
lol many quitted learning python after this video 😂😂🙏
Sir, kindly accept my regards. I wish I had come across your videos a couple of years earlier. You provide so much in-depth knowledge for free. Unbelievable. I have only one request. Can you also someday come up with a playlist that could help people prepare themselves for coding interviews in big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. Can you have in it concepts like Dynamic programming, Greedy method, Tree and Graph traversals, two-pointer methods, time complexity, etc??? It would be gold.
Nothing expalined about duck typing waste of time
Three Types of Duck Duck Duck
Super
this is the most confusing tutorial about duck typing i have ever seen
May be this helps who doesn&#39;t get the duck typing ...<br><br>1.                     class HP:<br> 2.                                  def laptop(self):<br> 3.                                 print(&quot;From HP brand&quot;)<br><br>4.                    class Dell:<br>5.                                  def laptop(self):<br>6.                                 print(&quot;From DELL brand&quot;)<br><br><br>7.                   class Student:<br>8.                               def Shilpi(self, brand):<br>9.                               print(&quot;This is a student&quot;)<br>10.                            s2.laptop()<br><br><br>11.                  s1 = Student()<br>12.                  s2 = HP()<br>13.                  s3 = Dell()<br>14.                  s1.Shilpi(s3)<br><br>Important Points : <br>A. In student class , we have provided an argument that is &quot;brand&quot; , and in (line : 14) , we have passed an object (belongs to dell class)<br>B. We could provide the object of class HP(line : 12) or class Dell(line:13) , because both have function laptop().<br>C. As we know , it doesn&#39;t matter what object from which class we are providing in (line : 14) , Then what matters ??<br>D. The object which we are providing as an argument(line : 14) should have the function laptop(). [This matters only , that&#39;s it]<br>This is Duck typing.<br>Correct me please if i am wrong , Sharing is caring :)
Sir, you explained inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction. But you didn&#39;t explain encapsulation, which is also an important part of OOP. If possible please make a video of it.
Hi Navin, what&#39;s the actual use of duck typing?
syntax error is coming
class pycharm:<br>    def execute(self):<br>        print(&quot;compiling&quot;)<br>        print(&quot;running&quot;)<br><br>class owneditior:<br>    def execute(self):<br>        print(&quot;compiling&quot;)<br>        print(&quot;running&quot;<br><br>class laptop:<br>    def code(self,ide):<br>        ide.execute()<br><br><br>ide = owneditior()<br>lap1 = laptop()<br>lap1.code(ide)
yuuuhuuu tysmmm
you made my quarantine productive.. thank you so much
You should make this understand better the concept is not at all clear to me

I am handsome like Brad Pitt<br>I dress like Brad Pitt<br>so I must be Brad Pitt<br>even if i only had 5 bucks in my pocket, I am still Brad Pitt.<br>.<br>right?
Mycharm<br>He probably decided his own editor name too
All your videos are amazing except this one. Couldn&#39;t get the concept even after watching multiple times.
i became a duck now
Please make another video on duck typing
try this to completely understand how the constructor works. Here, Laptop(), MyEditor() and Pycharm() would work as constructors<br>Laptop().code(PyCharm())<br><br>Laptop().code(MyEditor())
The example was great but a bit confusing.  Finally that was awesome. Loved it ♥.
why do we use duck typing,i dint get well., can u elaborate more
funny how u always say &quot;if u came from different background like java or c#&quot;  and exclude php.....hahahahaha
class Duck:<br>       def fly(self): <br>              print(&quot;Duck flying&quot;) <br>class Sparrow: <br>      def fly(self): <br>              print(&quot;Sparrow flying&quot;) <br>class Whale: <br>       def swim(self): <br>              print(&quot;Whale swimming&quot;) <br>for animal in Duck(), Sparrow(),Whale():            animal.fly() <br><br>Output:<br><br>Duck flying<br> Sparrow flying <br>AttributeError: <br>&#39;Whale&#39; object has no attribute &#39;fly&#39;
Hello sir, I did understand your example. But I couldn&#39;t get the coding concept here. Can you make a video defining this topic in more easier way? Your contribution is appreciated.
sir are you telugu?
AMAZING!!!
where do we use this &#39;duck typing&#39;... why its important
Plz... sir....machine learning all course upload
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuK0g8OFzwo&amp;t=4m10s"">4:10</a>  sir, here we are not inheriting Laptop from Pycharm but still we get the output. Why?
Pls make a another video on duck typing because it is little bit confusing
amazing way of explaining!!!!!!
very difficult to understand with this example and naming convention.
Sir ,could you please explain duck typing with more examples . It&#39;s a little bit confusing..
Quack Quack hahahah
little got struck can you explain brief this video
❤️
Good day,  I tried Inheritance while Duck Typing, but it is not working. Any reason why?
Isn&#39;t it similar to Golang , when we have a interface with various method signatures and some structs implements those methods ??
pythooooon....the way he says this is just funny
For those of you who had tough time figuring out what exactly duck typing is, I recommend going through Wikipedia example.<br><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing</a>
I think those who didn&#39;t understand the concept need to rewatch his video
Great example and simple explanation 👍🙂

What should be done in case we have to add variables? like in case of 2 objects we took self and other. What should be used in <i>_add_</i> in case we are using 3 type?
what is the use in this? can anyone explain me???
Sir, please make one more video on duck typing. This video was too fast. Could nt get the concept. It would be great if u add one more video on the same
sir, I couldn&#39;t get the meaning of duck typing .it was confusing can you explain it in simpler ways."

How can we add 3 objects using this method?
This video was very informative. Feels good to understand how magic methods works. Thanks Navin Sir!
Thank you sir :)
wow
better explained than my stupid professor, thanks.
I  can&#39;t getting <i>_div_</i> method for division can someone help me out
Sir , i was getting error
Awesome lecture.<br>Thank you sir 🙏
sir try to upload gui alsooo plzzzzzzzzz
As you have said that print(a) is same print(a.__str__()) but if we check type first print statement print(type(a)) then it gives (type int) and in 2nd statement print(type(a.__str__())) it gives (type string) how both can be same? if someone has understood this problem, kindly clarify.
A small doubt: for math operation like +, - , * , we can understand which method will be called. How to know which way of calling maps to which builtin method?<br>Eg. - How to know by calling print(a) will call __str__() ?
can  explain why its showing error while printing s3
Sir okkasari Telugu lo kuda videos cheyyandi sir ...meeru mana mother tongue lo chepthe keka untadi
I was here to learn what operator overloading is. At the time of the end of the video, I learned about the structure and how the things behind the scene gonna work. Take a Bow Navin Sir.
Sir Your videos are like preparing tastiest Briyani and giving it as service for free 😃🥰🥰
it&#39;s actually &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wd50TKv_OQ&amp;t=1m31s"">1:31</a>

Hi Naveen,<br>what are the programs used in Product development Programs <br>Kindly make video
&quot;This is horrible way to compare two students by marks&quot;<br><br>*goes on to compare and prints s1 wins😄😄😄😄
Why <i>add</i> code is not running<br>Error is showing that student() can&#39;t have arguments
meanwhile learning this, i thought of an excercise,<br><br>&#39;&#39;&#39;<br>beginner class excercise<br><br>make a class array such that it can store values like list or tuple,<br>make a repr/str method for that<br><br>overload __add__() method such that arrays can do element-wise addition<br>for example<br>if arr is my class then,<br><br>a1=arr(1,2)<br>a2=arr(3,4)<br><br>a4=a1+a2<br>print(a4)<br><br># o/p (4,6)<br><br>also raise error if both or all objects are not of same instance (i.e. array class here)<br>and also raise error if len of all objects are not same <br><br>also extend this over other operators like:  *,/,-,**,&gt;,&lt;,==,!=,&lt;=,&gt;=<br>&#39;&#39;&#39;
You are just a flame sir G
Excellent explanation
you are just awesome
So I’ve been suqqing ,short cowqz since it doesn’t jam my mouth. <br><br>Who’s in?
Bro, I was checking PyQt5 Module. I saw &quot;@typing.overload&quot; in most of the functions. I don&#39;t understand what are that for? Can you explain?
print  (&quot;this man is legend! Thank You So Much sir💗&quot;) - from Student class all over the world
this is the best channel on youtube to learn coding &lt;3
Should the title of the video be operator overriding.
Your classes are amazing...
Sir , is it necessary to learn c before <br>C++?
Thanks!
This is good and just.<br>Thank you.
Can&#39;t we directly inherit __add__() from int as parent class and use it??
also please explain the difference between data type and class.<br>is int, list , str a class or are they data type?
is there any relation between int class and str class if so what relation is it..<br>i gave the same example to the interviewer and he said i had wrong idea about polymorphism<br>and asked me if ther was some relation between the two classes
Navin sir ,I am completed oops concept then what i learn next .please give me the step be step solution for my question, and I want to learn Django frame work,with this point you gave me the step by step solution for after completing oops concept and what next
In greater than function y don&#39;t we use print true instead of return true. can anyone know, please tell me
Thank you so much!
I was frustrated since there’s no custom sort method for heapq. Hell i was Huma switch to c++ , but you explained it greatly
I ain&#39;t able to figure out the  example of operator overloading :(
After waching video in sequence this is the firts video i enjoy in diff way. ;)
👌👌
No doubt, explanation is quite perspicuous. <br>I am just curious how print(a+b+c) performed behind the scene because <i>_add_</i> can add only two number <br>Any Explanation/suggestion will be highly appreciated

i googled synthetic sugar but it showed results for syntactic sugar.....can u tel us the real term for it
THIS GUY Showing his nose after traveling through out the universe, actually he has to tell first simple example then he can show his vaast variety of expereince on us as beginners but directly he showing something else 99.9999999% from that the thing what we need is 0.0000000001% so its very confusing he did same for duck typing also, i dont understand what class or method or <i>_add_</i> fucking these all gonna do with simple operator overloading????🤣🤣, GUYS DO WATCH OTHER VIDEOS DONT RELY ON HIM , In the begining i like his videos but for critical things he is making more critial hell
If we have two class, <br> Class BookX:<br>       def __init__(self, pages) :<br>               self. pages=pages<br>       def __add__(self, other) :<br>               return self. pages+other.pages<br>Class BookY:<br>       def __init__(self, pages) :<br>               self. pages=pages<br><br>x=BookX(100) <br>y=BookY(150) <br>print(&quot;Total pages =&quot;, x+y) <br><br>In this code why we are giving the add method in first class and why not in second class??

how to take the values of m1,m2 from the user?
you have told the add method takes two arguemets, what if we have to add more than two?

this is not so easy to understand, you did it also very quickly.. anyway thank u very much ..
Sir can we do something like<br>S4=s1+s2+s3??
I love you bro!!! <br>superb..
Sir, when str method is overloaded, why print(s1) did not work to give tuple atleast....why did it ask for string ,we can use print statement to print tuple also right!!!!!!!!
In the code of addition <br>def __add__(self, other):<br>        m1 = self.m1 + self.m2 <br>        m2 = other.m1 + other.m2<br>         s3 = Student (m1, m2) <br>This is correct"

Sir I am from humanities background and currently working as a professional Interior Designer. I am 31years old and recently my partner suggested me to have a look into your videos when I told her I want to learn Python. I have no prior knowledge of coding or anything but after seeing and watching your videos I must say I am in love with the way you teach. If I can ever switch my career from being a designer to a developer of coder, I would thank you from the core of my heart. I am learning so much from you. Thank you once again.
Yes default arguments will replace if any arguments missed at position..
That was such a cool example...got the concept just like that

your teaching is best sir thank you for such content.😀
Kudos🤩 , his explanation of standards and quality is awesome ....phone overrides ex is unique &amp; top notch
Clear Explanation❤️
That&#39;s a great example i never forget overriding and inheritance from now thanks a lot 👍
Your explanation is easy to understand for everyone
sir can&#39;t we do simply a*
Damn goodd example!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Simply brilliant
i would have NEVER understood this topic in my university. you made it so simple!!
hello sir, can u plz put up a video on the topic &quot;Encapsulation in python&quot;
Really sir your every class is so helpful for me.
Thank you sir for this concept very nicely explain
I am become fan of your phone example with Method Overriding <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
Brilliant !<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
Shows stuff simplistically to the point of showing bad practiceses
Thank you sir
Nokia motorola Example is the best
You are the GOD 😇
sir, we are learning python from you...but I&#39;d like to know how did you learn it in such a detailed way?
Simple trick<br>class Miles:<br>    def sum(self,x= 0,y=0,z=0):<br>        sum=x+y+z<br>        print(sum)<br><br>r1=Miles()<br>r1.sum(1,3)<br><br>class Miles:<br>    def mul(self,x= 1,y=1,z=1):<br>        mul=x*y*z<br>        print(mul)<br><br>r1=Miles()<br>r1.mul(1,3)
Awesome class sir...  brilliant teaching... I never forget about Method overriding in my life...<br>🙏
Was unable to understand the concept of Method Overriding. But the way you taught this concept, was amazing. Great job!
This phone example was the best which I got in this topic all over the internet. ✅ ❤️ Explained
sir you explain in a such nice way!! thank you!!
thank you very much<br>i understand everything from you
while explaining the Method Overloading, if we set the values of a,b,c to 0 like a=0,b=0,c=0 then we don&#39;t have to do all the checks using if condition ? we can call even with a single arg and it would still work
dammn the phone example
Can You explain&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When to use OverLoading And When OverRiding????????
hey i got this override symball on my pycharm ...how to remove that symball ....its created by pressing some random key on keyboard...i dont know how to remove it know .....its overriding methods in objects...may i face any problem due to this symball??

that example clears all of my doubts about over riding topic.
Wooow... U explained the function overriding sooo well😀
Thank you Mr. Reddy! I really appreciate it.
great
Overriding example is superb
Overriding is same as MRO(Method Resolution Order), right??

Sir is world&#39;s number 1 teacher. No doubt on this. 🤗🤗
Great explanation 👌
Nice example sir.❤️
Instead of using none we can use zero? Which can make method smaller?
Why those 52 dislikes??
We are learning python from you, where you learnt it from?

&quot;Method Overriding &quot; love u sir,u r god
That father son example is just wow 🔥
Great explanation! Thank you!
last exmaple was awesome
class Student:<br><br>	def sum(self,num1=0,num2=0,num3=0):<br>		print(num1+num2+num3)<br>		<br>s1 = Student()<br>s1.sum(5,8)     # 13<br># can this be done for method overloading?

Method overriding set backs when father  have iPhone and I have normal phone....I would say iphone lol😂
now thats what i call a real life examples relelatable to everyone ..
Best explanation
just what I needed. I think....
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcTzTuIsoFk&amp;t=6m15s"">6:15</a> for method overloading, it would be better to pass 0 than None as we can skip that if condition.
nice tutorial, plz make tutorial on Pandas...
OMG that was the best example, I&#39;ve ever heard
why are we taking init method in method overloading ? what is the use?<br>what is the use of line s1=student(58,65)
me wants to learn python - panik<br>finds telusko - kalm<br>he uses light mode - panik
Nice video
good
Insted of having none we can use default argument as 0 so ther will no use of using if statements.
very concise<br>find me a better teacher than him, I will wait.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcTzTuIsoFk&amp;t=6m07s"">6:07</a> you don&#39;t need that lengthy code just set default values of a, b, c as 0
I will never forget method overriding in my life!!
Navin sir, what is the difference between parameters and arguments.
The father example for method overiding was a brilliant example!!!
it is same as inheritance
Op example sir, hats off to you sir ❤💕❤💕❤
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌.. Super explanation sir.....
sir you have face cut like  malayalam actor vinay fort
Why do we even need the below lines in method overloading example?<br><br>def __init__(self):<br>    self.m1 = m1<br>    self.m2 = m2
crystal clear explanation for method overriding
sir please bring up series of python for intermediates .
Excellent use of example - easy to understand! Thank you
you are a great teacher Naveen sir thanks for teaching us python for free.  i was going to buy a book to learn python but when i started watching your videos i thought that i dont need one
Nokia 1100😍<br>We can use it as a weapon as well<br>Ult battery
Is there a way to count how many attributes i am passing in a object? Like in custom len fucntion? <br>I tried to do it in that way but can&#39;t find the way to do it.  😕
Amazing video. :)

You just implemented the exact thing that my teacher taugh me in my Object Oriented Design lecture...<br>Thank you so much for the video.....❤
I have a doubt that, what is the significance of abstract method because method overloading and inheritance seems to be same as abstract classes... couldn&#39;t find the difference in between them...can you please help in this?
wait ! what? you called me alien? i liked though <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
nice explanation of the concept. But the usecase explanation wasn&#39;t effective honestly
can you please help with practice problems to go through th concept abstract class
Dude your playlist title says &quot;Python for beginners&quot;...but with your super pace of explanations, no beginners will understand the concepts. Your way of tutoring is way too hard to understand for the beginners. I would not suggest to <br>follow these videos to any of the beginners to learn Python.
ABC stands for ??
you know.. everything is great in this course, but there is one big big issue, and that is you never make a real example of these concepts, why we should use them, when we should use them (in a real example) for example, data mining, app development etc... please do something about it
so basically an abstract class and method is a way to force child classes into having certain methods
navin sir  can we implement classes? like java
What are the benefits of Abstract class? <br>Why do we use it ??
My eyes are burning. Does search and rescue use your IDE as a floodlight?
literally tooooo confusing!!!
You did not say what abstract class is, you just said what it has. Also, you did not explain why abstract class is needed. You&#39;ve used many words and examples which don&#39;t prove anything. You could have created 2 classes and called their methods after instantiation without the use of abstract method. It is redundant here.
me instead of creating abstract class<br><br>class error:<br>            def shout (self)<br>            print (&quot;chutiya hai kya&quot;)<br><br>err = error ()
The best teacher
Not a good explanatiion
work
why com.process() is used in class Programmer??
not working
If you want to learn how to use intelligent AI to automatically generate code for you in numerous programming languages, watch our mind-blowing video on our YouTube channel.
no
nahi aaya samaj
Ok so if you need to create multiple class objects which all have something in common and which you need to imperatively implement because you will later need to call (such as obj.process() in this video), then you use an ABC class and enforce the child classes to all have the set of methods you want. That&#39;s what I understand.
You don&#39;t have clear idea of what abstract classes are. If you really want to help your viewers then make another video of ABCs and show some concrete details. Thank You!
Sir, could you do future videos on  how to pass python certificiations, specifically the PCPP (Python institute professional certfied). By the way, brilliant instruction. Thanks
Absolutely Brilliant Video! Thanks
By the defination, abstraction is used to hide complexity of program but this defination doesn&#39;t seems appropriate in python implementation of abstraction.
Don&#39;t understand!!!
8 : 31 it starts messing up
Pretty poor explanation with a lot of unnecessary information
I am pretty much sure I have missed something, but I am not sure what it <a href=""http://is.at/"">is.At</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDmJGvM-OUw&amp;t=5m11s"">5:11</a> - I got the concept that if you inherit an Abstract class, the child class will also be Abstract. That I understood, tried and was successful.<br>But didn&#39;t properly get the concept after that. If the parent class is an Abstract Class, and if the child class has its own methods, the methods of the child class run without a problem. Have I got it right?
The concept is actually tough to understand here if we don&#39;t have basic understanding of Java abstract class.. But very nicely explained. ❤🎉
I enjoyed the simplicity of the video but abstract classes seem somewhat useless. Maybe it&#39;s just me.
Sir this video is little confusing . I used computer inside whiteboard class then I should get the output right ? But I&#39;m getting error that can&#39;t instantiate abstract calss whiteboard with abstract mathods process
Great explaination, but can you please differentiate between inheritance and abstraction. Anyone can answer to it to spread knowledge. Thanks.
super cool!😺
can do this namely take instance from child class by abstrac class
Nice
No
Is this done to achieve abstraction from oops concept , please I need answer
This video is a bit confusing...
it will work
Sir start data structures and algorithms with python
Good Explanation !
No
What can we do about interface like java ? Say, we need to implement strategic design patter like java we cannot use interface ,what should we do then ?
Please, use dark theme, my eyes are aching
Respected and honourable sir ,i have been learning python from scratch only on your YouTube channel.<br>I wanna thank you from bottom of my heart.Till now i didn&#39;t face any problem or confusion.but now i was Little bit confused about the abstract class, why do we use and why do we need them.<br><b>**I have come up with a conclusion that : we use abstract classes and abstract method to override the abstract method again and again in other subclasses of abstract class.**</b><br>If it is correct? kindly reply.Big fan sir❤️...God bless you
I&#39;m new here. Why are we aliens again?
Miss The spinning cube.
YOU DON&#39;T USE DARK MODE  !?<br>I BET YOU CAN STARE DIRECTLY AT SUN FOR HOURS !
Sir can you please start machine learning!
It will not work
For the first time I&#39;m confused 🙂 ...can you please explain it deeply... It&#39;s not clear why should we need abstract class and methods
Thank you very much!
Put another video based on this topic sir it&#39;s only 70%clear
Very informative video. I have one doubt. I don&#39;t agree with this statement - &quot;An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have  a definition.&quot; <br>We can define the abstract method and use it later with super function. Right?
Thank you
Probably need more explanation about this topic. Why we need to create abstract classes. But among all of the youtube videos, this is much much better than others. Thank you...
The println macro at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDmJGvM-OUw&amp;t=7m35s"">7:35</a>, you had been writing Rust haha
sie what happened in this video u looked very dull
Essentially, you define abstract methods in an abstract class to ensure that it&#39;s child classes have a compulsion of having those methods defined inside them
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDmJGvM-OUw&amp;t=9m51s"">9:51</a> my  output comes only &#39;solving bugs&#39;..that com.process is not executing..i dont understand what is happening and there is no error showing
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDmJGvM-OUw&amp;t=4m50s"">4:50</a> I expect it to work, because we are creating an object  of a concrete rather than abstract class
No
Please add video for encapsulation concept(__x) to restrict input.<br>Thanks!
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDmJGvM-OUw&amp;t=4m38s"">4:38</a> : No, it won&#39;t work. The class that inherits an abstract class is also an abstract class and can&#39;t be instantiated.
tq
make series on python turtle
Abstract class sounds like&quot; Copy right of you tube&quot; where u need to &quot;give credit&quot; by defining all abstract methods of parent class
Thanks for the short explanation!
No it will not work coz it is subclass of Abstract class
sorry, I was too focused to like the videos.
Bro need a video abt encapsulation
from abc import *<br><br>class examhall:<br>	@abstractmethod<br>	def instrument_box(self):<br>		pass<br>		#&#39;bring instrument box&#39;<br><br>	def water_bottle(self):<br>		print(&#39;bring water bottle&#39;)<br><br>class students1(examhall):<br><br>	def maths(self):<br>		print(&#39;ok, i sure need one for the test&#39;)<br>	<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23so"">#so</a> let me define an instument box<br>	def instrument_box(self):<br>		print(&#39;pencils, compass, ruler etc&#39;)<br><br>class students2(examhall):<br><br>	def social(self):<br>		print(&#39;but i dont need one anyway&#39;)<br>	<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23but"">#but</a> since its compulsory, let me bring an empty one<br>	def instrument_box(self):<br>		print(&#39;empty box&#39;) <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23or"">#or</a> just pass<br><br>s1 = students1()<br>s2 = students2()<br><br>s1.maths()<br>s1.instrument_box()<br><br>s2.social()<br>s2.instrument_box()
I see many are still confused with the concept and also with &quot;how is it different from duck typing&quot;. Here is an example to get it cleared. <br><br>This is an exam &#39;hall&#39; and there are students from 2 diffrent &#39;classes&#39; seated. Class A has a maths test, Class B has social.<br><br>The invigilator says that to enter the hall, every one must carry an instrument box. Now students of classes both A and B must bring one even if B class don&#39;t have its use. So the class A will have a set of compass, rulers, pencils etc in it. But since students of class B don&#39;t have any use, they will just bring one with a pencil or even just empty (pass) because its compulsory to bring one in to be in the hall.<br><br>If a parent class has an abstract method, every child must also have one. So each child will have to define one of thier own.<br><br>In duck typing, It isn&#39;t necessary to define the parent class method for each child classes. it just simply have to point to the class where the particular method lies. Here we would have to define for each.<br><br>I hope this helps
can a non abstract class have abstract methods in python ..in java,c++ its not but what about python
nice
Sir..can u explain acm ICPC 2015 world finals problem c catering in python..??
yes
Previous background was waaaayyyyyy better
yes it will  work but we did not get anything
He doesnt want to work today
I Think u missed some logic, i have to refer other utubers to understand about abstract classes and methods., i did not understand in reverse i got messed up., i learned from other videos about navin&#39;s made mistake by taking whiteboard, bcos of white board it is confusing, actually abstract means ABSTRACT METHOD, Computer class forcing by making must to use abstract methods in those classes.
When he types println! upppss! :p
sir we cant import abs it is giving error<br>plzz help it out
how can we define a variable in abstract
perfect
Thank you for wasting the time
it was soooo confusing<br><br> pta nhi kiya kri jarha hoooo
Concept is not reached
Summary:<br>abstract method is a method which only has declaration and doesn&#39;t have definition.<br>a class is called abstract class only if it has at least one abstract method.<br>when you inherit a abstract class as a parent to the child class, the child class should define all the abstract method present in parent class.<br>if it is not done then child class also becomes abstract class automatically.<br>at last, python by default doesn&#39;t support abstract class and abstract method, so there is a package called ABC(abstract base classes) by which we can make a class or method abstract.
Thanks for the video. but you can make it better
The same program i have executed but still the same error<br>TypeError: Can&#39;t instantiate abstract class ChildABST with abstract methods AbsMet<br>here in the video naveen executed successfully but it&#39;s not when i tried with the same, what&#39;s wrong it has i dont understand
no&#39;
Can you please explain more on why do we need abstract classes? It&#39;s not very clear to me. <br>This will be really helpful. Thanks!

It prints 1to10 but if we remove for loop it will give you only one
nice jacket
What happens if we print(next(it)) beyond the range of list? I mean what if we use print statement 6 time if the list has only 5 values? And can we access the index of an element using iter() and next()?
Im sorry to say your explanation is becoming staler and actually complicates the concepts,for the last 3 videos including this one .i had to go to another video and learn it and comeback here.i hope i don&#39;t have to do that every video from now on
In if condition can we use break to stop the iteration <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyu08G2l71c&amp;t=9m33s"">9:33</a>
There was an indentation error at return val thats why its repeating., remove 1 space before return.
nice video
Where are you from?
shikhar dhawan op
Good
how many of you went back video and see he have mustache(search meaning in google) of our teacher 😂🤣🤣
If you want to work the loop for multiple times put &quot;self.num = 1&quot; in else condition.
Excellent video! Thank you
we are hearing to learn, not checking your talent.
If you type<br>print(next(values))<br>after the for loop, you will get an Error.
pythoooooooooonnnn
i geniunly have a hatred toward people using light mode
Finally I got this yayyyyy

I like your moustache
I&#39;m not an alien, thus, I&#39;ll always skip the first 10 sec of your videos.
Sir, <br>Why can&#39;t we use break in else part to stop the execution of for loop ?
sir could you please suggest me a source from where i can practice python, please!!
I still can&#39;t seem to comprehend the word iterate, aswell when he says it &#39;loops&#39; over. I would really appreciate if anyone could dumb down the explanation as much as possible I&#39;m desperate to understand this concept lol. Thank you in advance
By this way are v overloading the Iter &amp; next inbuilt function ?
Mota badu
Thank you Mr. Reddy!
def __iter__(self):<br>        return self<br><br>What is the reason of using it? Can anyone explain?
If something is returned in a function it return value to function call right ? What  is  happening  to return here. Object is being returned......
the answer is:<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10
since we already have for loop to iterate the list then why are we making things more complex by making this iterator
&#39;1&#39; will be printed twice as the &#39;for loop&#39; always starts from the 1st element in the list. so both are different things and it will give the twice ones then will continue up to what we want to print.
The raise keyword is used to raise an exception. You can define what kind of error to raise(here its StopIteration).
after a long time i have seen your mustache
same value
tq
please make series on python turtle
hiii bro, create the own class that not repeat again values...but inbuild the value or nums it can repeating ....i wanna clear about it this video
What does that __iter__() method do here sir
can we use break instead of &quot;raise stop iteration&quot;
why even without calling iter and next methods they are running
looking handsome
Thank you Mr. Navin !
In pycharm you can use (control + d) to copy the line and paste it onto the next in the place of using (ctrl + c) and (ctrl + v).
To be honest i understood this better from u sir in comparison to code with harry ,i m not comparing but actually u r a little better in explaining , don&#39;t kill me code with harry fans i am also his fan it&#39;s just my opinion
print statement prints 1 and the for loop prints 2, 3, 4,..., 10
It will give all ten value once
Bhaya samajh ni aya
wow you really explain well and are one of the few indians that have no accent almost respect
The when you say Iterators. How cool is that..

I&#39;m confused. Couldn&#39;t we just print &quot;nums&quot; to output the values? Why did we need a &quot;for&quot; statement to display all 4 values?
Dil se dhanywaad🙏✌️🤗
This confuse me<br>Why we use this concept
modified iterators form where to start and where to stop:<br>class ur_choice:<br>    def __init__(self, num):<br>        self.nums = int(input(&#39;enter from where to start&#39;))<br><br>    def __iter__(self):<br>        return self<br><br>    def __next__(self):<br>        if self.nums &lt;= num:<br>            val = self.nums<br>            self.nums += 1<br>            return val<br>        else:<br>            raise StopIteration<br><br><br>num = int(input(&quot;enter where to stop&quot;))<br>values = ur_choice(num)<br>for i in values:<br>    print(i)
Why do we need the iter() method while defining our own iterator???
Sir, mere palle kuch bhi nahi pad raha hai
Good sir ji👍👍👍
what is the use i dint understand<br>when u want to print one by one it is done in 1st example<br>bt in 2ns e ample own iterator all numbers are printed at once not as u told one by one<br>dint understand what’s the real use u want to tell sir
sir why are we using raise ? can we not use break
hiii bro, create the own class that not repeat again values...but inbuild the value or nums it can repeating ....i wanna clear about it this video
Sir, why to use iterators???<br>Naveen sir please clear this doubt
It will print 1 or 11?
class top ten is not clear
Sir class vala bilkul smj ni aaya
It&#39;s very funny when you said to NONE iteration &quot;eehh HOLD on&quot;
sir any real world example of iterator ? and difference between iterator and generator ?
Nice mustache! It suits you Sir. :-)
Hey if we have for loop to print 1 to 10 number, why should we use this iterator
Write a python program using recursion to traverse every single element of the nested <br>list.  <br>[10,20,15,[11,”hello”,25.5,[123,15,”hi”,[10,20],52],100,200],15,50,[51,”welcome”],1000<br>]

is there any way of using variable in place of self.num = 1 means self.num = n and then iterate it for 10 times
Sir why can&#39;t we use break statement 🤔🤔
sir!!!! in the before example u have shown the repeation of values getting in output...but in this example why it is not repaeting 1 and taking next values......
So why we use loop if we have iterators
Sir,  At last when we call print values then we should two ones because of init function and other one is because of iter function but we are getting only one value of 1. I am not understanding this can you help me in this.
I am beginner in coding... started directly with you videos. Doubt here... with for loop code simpler than iterator then why iterator should be used?
sir i have a question <br>Why u used &quot; raise StopIteration &quot; ? why not u use &quot; Break &quot; instead ??? please explain anyone
if I use exit() instead of Raise Iteration then what problem would I face?
Can we use &quot;break&quot; in else statement to stop the loop?
Object is not iterable  sir what&#39;s the prblm
Where are we calling next function in for loop and without calling it how the value are printing??
sir can you let us know a real life example where we use iterator
Sir, can we use limiter in <i>_next_</i>
Sire, in object creation we have created <i>_iter_</i> function but we didn&#39;t called to make that object as iterator. Then how does it work???
I really Want to thank you Navin Sir..My college faculty never focus on the concepts of programming they are just making us rattutota... Thank you so much sir for coming on youtube and helping the students
sir can you put another vedio on this. i dint understand completely.
For me it&#39;s showing topten object is not iterable
Nice!
Why only return self is use under iter block
Can someone or Navin tell me this that why are we not converting that TopTen class object &#39;values&#39; to iterator object i.e like values = iter(values)  <br>As you are not creating iterator object in last example how is <i>_iter_</i> method getting called or how is it working without it.<br>As far as i know if we create an object of class only init method gets performed without calling.<br>Please Help me with this.<br>And Cheers to your work Navin.<br>Thank you very much
sir how to do text parsing in python?
Sir why did you use if statement in next method. Is there any problem ,if we use (if statement) in for loop

Why do we use iterators and generators in real life?
What a great explanation! Thank you so much.
Understood... Thanks :)
thanks sir.. your videos are awesome, and it makes us feel like coding is tricky but easy.
Hi Navin sir , Thank you somuch for making each and every concept so simple and understandable .keep up the good work.
its very tough to understand your way of explaining.
so what i don&#39;t get is that where we can use this
you are superb sir
Video and Content quality is Amazing sirG🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Hey Naveen Coz of You I have learned Python and Django perfectly Thank You So Much :-) Love from Hyderabad 😍
sir u r  looking  different in this vedio
Very much interesting!! And clear about all concept and doubts.
Clean Explanation!!!
so for loops are iterator implementations ???
def gen():<br>	i=0<br>	j=1<br>	k=0<br>	yield 0<br>	yield 1<br>	while k&lt;10:<br>		<br>	   sum= i+j<br>	   yield sum<br>	   i=j<br>	   j=sum<br>	   k+=1<br>	<br>	<br>	<br><br><br>a=gen()<br>while True:<br>		<br>		inp98776=input(&quot;Enter next  arrow for next or Enter S to stop and exit the program&quot;)<br>		if inp98776==&quot;&quot;:<br>			print(&quot;  &quot;,a.__next__(),end=&quot; &quot;)<br>		<br>		else:<br>			break
class twenty():<br><br>    n=1<br><br>    while n &lt;= 20:<br>        sq = n*n<br>        yield sq<br>        n +=1<br><br>values= twenty()<br><br>for i in values:<br>    print(i)<br><br>similar code but i am getting error . The error is Syntax Error: &#39;yield&#39; outside function
Why do we need generator and iterator ,if we can iterate using loops
Amazing explanation in every video. Very useful to clear the concepts.
thanks
You did not explain how yield works i.e does the function just &quot;stop&quot; in time when it reaches yield and how does for loop know that no more yields are coming?
Easy to understand explanation and example thank you very much bro✌🏻
great to understand
tq
make series on python turtle
Sir O/p may be 1,2,1,2,3,4 right
sir, I am understood the your lectures ,that is very interesting .Thanks a lot.
can someone clarify..why is while being executed once at a time??
enjoying your videos ..... We got to know much more deep information from your explantaion
fantastic concept!!!
What bhayya u only taught iterators and now saying what is the use of iterators to print one by one 🤣🤣🤣
Hi, I have a clarification how the code worked. We just created &quot;values&quot; object. We didn&#39;t call any methods, but still how it is printing. Generally we have to call the method (eg:- values.__iter__()  or values.__next__()) right?<br>Is there anything like the methods declared with dunders(___x__()) will be executed automatically when you create an instance.<br>When we gave &quot;print(next(values))&quot; it printed only once, where as in for loop it printed 10 times. So how the variable &#39;i&#39; knows its iteration value. Can anyone help
To the person who is reading this, you are very precious and valuable even if you don&#39;t feel so. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose again on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don&#39;t end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won&#39;t grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don&#39;t have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don&#39;t let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn&#39;t want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him &quot;sincerely&quot; if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won&#39;t lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don&#39;t know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don&#39;t want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.
if we can use for loop then what is the need of next(). can you please clarify
Thanks!
Great Video
sir the same thing be done without yield
This is awesome explanation. Keep going. It helps python community
Sir, what was the use of all these things if we had to use for loop at the end for printing values ?<br>Please anyone EXPLAIN !!!
Love your style of explaining things very efficiently 👍👍👍
We normally fetch the records in a cursor then  loop thru and process one record at a time rt?  Yes, we are fetching 1000 records into memory with the cursor, we can overcome this with Generators is what you mean?  little confusion , someone pls clarify
Awesome
Excellent explanation.. Thanku..
can we use genrator inside the class ? if yes anyone explain me with example?
SUPER SIR
Can we write this statement instead of the while loop?<br>    for i in range (1,11):<br>           sq=i*i<br>           yield sq
You said that Generators do not work in methods but do in functions, which means it can not be made in a class, but, i actually did it and that to in a static method inside of a class.
Awesome sir very nice. I am following python series from the very beginning and will go till the End
I didn&#39;t get the difference between this iterator and generator.. Can anyone help me out with this!!!!
informational video, but the music at the start and end irritates. overall it&#39;s a nice video... thanks
you are so cool, can I be your friend?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mziIj4M_uwk&amp;t=5m10s"">5:10</a><br><br>So an iterator fetches all items in a sequence first?
Eeeeeld = yield ?!<br>which means<br>Eellow = yellow
Why not class?
As per example the data came at once for all, so how do we differentiate between iterator and generator.
just awesome sir &lt;3
I discovered your channel recently and I&#39;ve been enjoying your good work. Please keep it up.
I am studying 11th standard. I don&#39;t know whether genetators are there in 11th portion. Please reply whether these portions are there for me.
why can&#39;t we use a for loop here instead of while loop? pls explain
what &#39;s an explanation, pretty excellent!
why we have to write 15-16  of code just to print 1--10 values. this can be  easily done with the help of loops
you are amazinggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
the best explanation on the internet.   good job
+++  when use yield  the MAIN value of the function will be the one that assigned to yield (sq)<br>+++when ask for the function (which main value of it is the one that assigned to yield because of yield effect) will give you the next value of the variable that assigned to yield (sq) and that was the main two features of yield
this course is best ,ultimate best
❤
if i replace yield using return then the code is failing - &#39;int&#39; object is not iterable - pls stat whats issue here
I am grateful to you sir....<br>Very Nice teaching sir...........
thanks
Very well explained . Thanks.
print(&quot;sir you looks good in mustache and you teaching method() is also very impressive&quot;)
you are looking like shikhar dhawan
Thank you sir for this informative video, subscribed
superb
Thank you Naveen Reddy Sir for your series on python..It helped me to learn in an easy manner ...Thank you so much
Thank u Sir!
In my code instead of _next_() next() is working.....
videos are getting very much interesting as we go towards the end of the course...thankyou sir !!
def table():<br>    n = int(input(&#39;enter value to find table of it:&#39;))<br>    itt = 1<br>    while itt &lt;= 10:<br>        t = n * itt<br>        yield t<br>        itt += 1<br><br><br>values = table()<br>for i in values:<br>    print(i)<br><br>i created table finder using generator
hi..is it  really necessary to have a knowledge on  full python for data science..
great
sir please make a video  on how to make a website using python. we expect that...  .  many people are already  teaching to make a website but no one good for nothing .because they are not reliable we rely on you.
good job
Which ide you are using
Hi Sir, I have a query regarding the file handling videos, can you please make a separate video on file handling, how to upload the image, song etc. I will be thankful to you if you make so.
Hi can you make videos of Linux , Jenkins  and devops
We can also creat generator with generator comprehension...<br>G = (i for i in range(1,10))
Awesome , Thank you Sir"

I love your teaching style, clear and and easy to understand
Awesome
Sir, is it necessary to use a finally block as the statements after the except block will be executed any way.
your explanation is great sir. understood the whole concept clearly<br>thank you
I m learning python 1st time from your Chanel .. it’s really helpful ..thank you sir
Sooperb explanation.:)
there is also rise keyword we use in exception handling , you should have covered it...
Simply simplified my doubt
It helps me to switch !!
sir you are superb
Navin your videos are amazing.<br>Navin, please specify else block as well. i.e, try block  for checking any error, except block will handle the error, else block will execute if there is no error, and finally block will excecute regardless  the result of try and except block.
Nice acting guru especially when it is wired 😂
Tysm!!
Great Explanation
sir ,you have versatility in the teaching and i  am lucky  to see  this channel
Wow. Nice explanation. Thank you.........
Very good explanation sir .thank you.
This is how  you teach. keep it basic/simple. Thanks, great job.
Dear sir! <br>you deserve much.<br>Thanks a lot
Telusko team i love u guys 😍
Thank you! You explained this very well :D
sir your teaching style is so good.
at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SPDvPK38tw&amp;t=6m57s"">6:57</a> sir according to you - ACCEPT but  according to python - EXCEPT
My favorite navin sir
Love you sir 🧚🏻‍♂️
Not cool write ups too small
Awesome one!
TQ anna
the practical world understanding of software world you provide as in explaining finally snippet is awesome man, too too cool man
Hi. I&#39;ve been trying to insert an input statement but everytime i try to put a character, the code is just running. As if i havent put a character. No error, no nothing. Just the statement in quotes<br>Help anyone?
Why shouldn&#39;t we use if else block instead of exception handling???
Thik Se Smajao Samj Nhi Araha H 🤨
Hi Navin, <br>you throw in a lot motivational points and give us a very clear picture of what exceptions are, why you might need them and you provide basic usage of the python &#39;try&#39;-&#39;except&#39; construct. Very well done! Now I feel fully prepared to try out some examples myself ( which I have already ...) as well as explore the nitty gritty details in the python documentation for specific applications and problems. WELL EXPLAINED, WELL DONE and THANK YOU!!
Will this work instead of finally??<br><br>Try:<br>    print(&quot;resource open&quot;)<br>    print(a/b)<br>except Exception as e:<br>    print(&quot;Hey, you cannot divide by 0&quot;, e)<br><br>print(&quot;resource closed&quot;)
Easy explanation 😁👍
marvelous bro keep it up👍
Believe me Sir, you are just a fire
very clear and concise, awesome.
Navin sir :- God of Programming for me.....Helped me get through interview and many concept 😘
Great way to slip gynecologist into a Python course I laughed. I also learned how to use the statement. +2
Great teaching style! hats off for simplifying this concept✌
Since python is an interpreted language, it&#39;s interpreted instead of compiling, so we have the interpretion time
Not clear visible
Sir can you start java classes in a seqvenc of videos
👍
u made easier sir better than my teachers or frnds thanks a lot
Everytime I view your tutorials I just make sure make sure to click that big fat like button  and I move to watch that video you&#39;re simply awesome it&#39;s just a crystal clear thankyou sir
Sir, मौज कर दी
Thank you, I understood errors and exception. Great explanation!
Sir, you did it great. Thank you.❤
HEY GURU OF ALIENS.....COULD U PLEASE START VIDEOS ON DATA STRUCTURE THROUGH PYTHON?????????
It&#39;s always good practice to write specific exception which we aware. If we don&#39;t know what kind of error will occur then Parent Exception.. Taught by Naveen Automation Labs.. same theory by Naveen Reddy.. Both were awesome in teaching.. 👍👍👍
Thanks a lot for such a great explantion!
Good class
You’re the best teacher in the world. Tutors in Udemy should take note from this lovely man.
we do not &quot;except&quot; , we rather &quot;accept&quot;<br>😅
i was struglling with this topic from long time. u made it just like clear water. thank u
thank you for this lesson, well digested
good video, the dynamic background is unsettling though
Damn!! You have no idea how much you have helped me for my internals by your videos😃
masterclass
just Thank you buddy
how to handle mutiple exception like if we have divide by zero error and also Value error at same time..this code is just jumping out of try block for the first exception and not detecting second one...tried with break/break_continue..but not getting expected output
Interesting that k is accepted even though it appears to be an undefined variable<br>Modified your code to accept inputs a and b:<br><br>a = 0<br>b = 0<br>try:<br>	print(&quot;Resource open: &quot;)<br>	<br>	a = int(input(&quot;Enter a numerator: &quot;))<br>	b = int(input(&quot;Enter a denominator: &quot;))<br>	print(a/b)<br>	<br>	# k = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))<br>	<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23print"">#print</a> (k)<br>	<br>except ZeroDivisionError as e:<br>	print(&quot;You cannot divide by zero&quot;, e)<br>	<br>except ValueError as e:<br>	print(&quot;Invalid input&quot;)<br>	<br>except Exception as e:<br>	print(&quot;Something went wrong&quot;)<br>	<br>finally:<br>	print(&quot;Resource closed&quot;)
Amazing Teaching skill. God bless you sir.
sir, what if two types of errors come in try block. Which exception it will handle and what about the execution of others?
Really great explained sir
But sir when the first condition has error like zero division error another isn&#39;t getting executing, simply source is getting <a href=""http://closed.do/"">closed.Do</a> we have to use separate exception for each try:
It was always confusing for me about the error handling. You made it crystal clear today. I like your simplicity in teaching complex concepts.
Excellent explanation. You are an extraordinary teacher🙏
Great teaching style sir all doubts are clear👌👌👍👍👍👍🎂
I&#39;m very grateful <br>Thank you so much sir  for great explanation ,
Hlo sir,<br>In exception handling<br>Sir you have said that example:<br>A=3<br>B=5<br>K=int(input(&quot;enter a nunber:&quot;)<br>Print(k)<br>Then,the strings are not getting the output <br>When we remove the int from the line then,it&#39;s working.And, executes without any error<br>Ex:<br>k=input(&quot;enter a number:&quot;)<br>Print(k)<br>Thank you sir ❤️
Sir i have a doubt:<br>a = 3<br>b = 0<br>If b != 0:<br>    print(a / b)<br>else:<br>     print(&quot;can&#39;t enter zero in b)<br><br>Sir, if this problem solved by if else, then i should we use Try-expcept. Please help i want to understand exception handling
Really I really appreciate your skills and the way you teach.... It&#39;s really easy to grasp  the topics which you teach............. Love you brother....... 👍👍👍👍👍... Keep it up
you look so yellowish!!
Sir your videos clearly shows you interest in learning new techs and the deep knowledge you have
This was simple like if else
Thank you Mr. Reddy!
Best way of explanation
Thanks for giving free excellence course for all
Hey Sir, should I continue Java as a Desktop developer or I shift to Python completely plz guide me.
Sir , what if we divide by zero but also want to execute enter the no.??
Telusko !! Liked the channel title!
Superb sir 👍
Phenomenal explanation... This guy doesn&#39;t throw unhandled error.
this man is a legend
Sir vere level..🔥🔥<br>Sir U r having such a skill🔥🔥

Excellent ....
Hello I have question ..when you are using the sleep between two thread ,then itself it reduce the speed of program ,so anyways it taking the benefit of Multithreading by reducing the speed.?
i have a small doubt...python runs a single thread at a time because of GILSo how does it use multiple cores.
helpful video sir ..thank you 👍
If I am paying for my cpu, I will use the whole cpu;
Very very useless video i can&#39;t understand any thing
The need in the software development community is to have developers that want to help society rather than their wallet. Like Charlie Monroe of downie.
Boss gundu boss🤙🤞
My heart goes for u 💜💜💜💜
sir advance sir please
i love you...you make soo easy<br>thank you
Great 👍 thank u so much 🙏🏻
Thank You
Awesome session sir, Thank u so much 🥰🤝🤩
Amazing simple explanation! No fluff, no beating around the bush. Thank you so much!
You know what Sir ! you are my love
Didn&#39;t even get confused for a bit even after listening at 1.5x Great tutorial!
Nice work gentlemen
Brother u r awesome in explaining concepts
you explanation is  extreemly fabulous, and i have a request from you please use static background for the video, becoz current background theme is create problem in focus.
That&#39;s weard 😱😱
You are misusing the word parallel. There is no true parallelism in python&#39;s multithreading because of GIL. These threads run concurrently
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqHLztqy0PU&amp;t=14m19s"">14:19</a> ... Hello Hi Hello Hi Hello Hi Hello Hi Hello Hi and the the power of joy(.join)😍
Awesome sir thank you
Would be nice to see concepts of synchronized etc. in python
sir what is  in the task manager we can have multiple threads and process running in system .. a basic question what is  difference between thread and process
hey i am new to your channel but i love u r explanation love you keep rocking man u r the rockstar in programming

why hi and hello not coming in same line?
It&#39;s working Priya .. it&#39;s working 💥
What is the maximum number of defining the thread
Big fan boss.👍
Hatsoff to your teaching sir 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you so much, for making this so simple.
multi-thread song:<br>I made a Minecraft clone and this is how it works. when ever a new block is made it is a new thread. mobs load there own chunks. so that it is more realistic  but if there is to many it will bog down the processor. it was written in python and the position of everything decides what it is...
what about multiprocessing?
lovely explanation :)
multi processing i guess is done through pool and multi threading simulation for pause and resume time slice process is done through threadpool execution.... Regular thread does not parallelize i guess. can u check and confirm pls
Also btw can you confirm if the multi threading in python is parallel execution . I think not. its restricted by GIL. Only multi processing does a parallel run. Muti threading still in python is time sliced run due to interpreter limitations.... Can you check and confrm. A curb around this is threadpool executer
can you as well post a video on how to limit the number of threads running at one instance.... Lets say I have a function that will take a parameter and will run accordingly producing different results.... But the list of parameters to be passed is more than 10000... The parameters comes to me from a csv list. Iterating through the parameter list I should spin off my functions.... I wanted to run this same function in parallel say 8 threads at an instance as i iterate through my parameters from the file in loop. Can you explain me how you run through the parameters and execute the functions in paralllela and restric it to 8 at a time. I will have to begin next thread only when the thread could &lt;8 lets say 2 out of 8 threads complete it should add another 2 threads to maintain 8 count.....
Good explanation.... Hi I should say that your articulation skills and capabilities have greatly improved from what I saw in last 2 years. You are doing an excellent job. Keep it up. In fact I remember giving you a negative feedback few years ago for a similar topic. Now I am really impressed with the content refinement and clear articulation. Thanks much and appreciate your work
Best teacher in the world 😍

Super
woow
Bye is gonna come in between Hi and Hello
Thanks for the tut. I would appreciate if you could answer my question. I have two separate algorithms, assume script1 and script2. By making them multithread, one thread for script1 and other thread for script2 can they share input/output with each other? or they will be run independently and they won&#39;t be able to communicate?
do we need always to call the method run, what if i call it first or else name instead of run?
You teach very well. Amazingly explained
Can we pass parameters in run method ?
That was a wonderful explanation of concepts, sir u r just awesome. If you can slow down your pace that would be really helpful for beginners but it was great.
Hi,<br>after doing sleep (0.2), still hi and hello merge. How is it possible?
Interesting video. But.......you are talking tooooo fast. 😮
Bro please do video on semaphores with threads
GOD OR WHAT!
Thank You so much sir
Thank you, sir.!!!!
HI... I am unable to execute the program shown in example. I get the following error &quot;cannot import name &#39;Thread&#39; from partially initialized module &#39;threading&#39; (most likely due to a circular import)&quot;. what is the issue here?

you are a true gem... helped me to solve a bug which last for the last two days.. Thankyou so much
How people put Dislike to this nice video!!!! ....  Need an option for MultiLike options.
Thank you sire for this nice structured topic<br>I&#39;m so excited to continue the remaining python topics
It is so easy to understand your tutorials

Hi Navin/Aliens,<br><br>I have a weird issue , when I&#39;m printing some lines from particular file, followed by copying the contents to next file, whatever i have printed not getting copied. Despite other contents are getting copied.<br><br>To be precise:<br><br>1. Once I print the content from 1st file.<br>2. I couldnt able to copy the full content to other file (the printed content is missing in 2nd file(not copied)).<br><br>anyone  try this code and let me know,<br><br>x = open(&#39;Notes&#39;, &#39;r&#39;)   <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23you"">#you</a> can create a new file with some sample and replace the filename<br><br>print(x.readline(), end=&quot; &quot;) <br>print(x.readline())  <br><br><br>x1 = open(&#39;demo&#39;, &#39;&#39;w&#39;)  <br><br>for i in x:<br>    x1.write(i)
I am not getting anything when I am using writing operation but it has created new file by using write operation but not writing anything in that file,it is showing blank space but it&#39;s working with read operation..... what&#39;s the problem?
😎❤️‍🩹
Paid 30k to institute &amp; learning from your videos for free😂
Can we write binary without you for loop?<br>Is there any direct method to do this
Really great and to the point lecture. Thanks
best
Thank You Brother❤
This is very usefull.can you add a video on regular expression in python

Which software is that u are using sir?
Intersting n tq sir
I can write read and write to a file in the same directory. How do I mention a path to which I want to read or write?
cool!❤
Thank you sir for making ur time for us about this python series it&#39;s very useful for me I enjoyed it and it&#39;s in a simple basic terms to be understandable for any person
This was very helpful for my programming class! Thank you! :)
Jesus loves you. Start a relationship with Him today before its too late.
It&#39;s generally a good practice to close a file after you&#39;re finished processing its contents. Thanks for the awesome vides.
thanks sir for sharing this video
pls try reducing bg audio hard to concentrate your words sir
did he say &quot;welcome back aliens&quot; !?
I keep running into &quot;no such file or directory&quot; how can I fix that I can see the file I need in the venv folder already.
You’re amazing!
Thanks now I have the motto to finish the whole course! i&#39;m at this point!

Anyone know how to add image on vs code?
Sir , how  to add a photo in particular file. Please..
I was doing course on python by meta in coursera, i was feeling bored but naveen did this boring topic in very intresting way.
Very helpful, thank you!
nice explain chesaru sir,thanks.
can we do this on idle....? if so how its needed to be done
Great tutorial, do you have an example of the same concept, but instead of using a txt file, using a PDF file?
F is NOT the file.  It is the file handle.
sir every time plz provide us source code for practice..
Naveen you are great!!!
Naveen you are great
non programming background, but able to learn easily ..all because of ur great explanation
The tutorial is good. It will be good to convey about the file close operation as well..otherwise this will result in handle leaks.
How to print the data word by word to text file from list(I.e every word in a new line)
Navin Sir, you explanation is exquisite, you give wonderful examples and the way you introduce the session by saying Hello Aliens is quite exemplary
Can someone tell me what idle this is
Really informative, apart from knowing about file handling, i learnt many new things , so kudo to you !!
When I typed this, the full first line got printed, I thought it will print the first 4 characters of line 1 and line 2 in full. What is the reason for this outcome?<br>f = open(&#39;Mydata.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;)<br>print(f.readline(4), end=&#39;&#39;)<br>print(f.readline())<br># Output : My Name is Navin Reddy
Should I tell it or not ? but I love you sir
This was awesome. Thank-you for this wonderful practical session

How can I read file from other directories?
Hello Navin! <br>I just stumbled upon this and can I just say, I love your way of teaching.<br>Instead of just sitting there and simply instructing us, you play around and experiment with the code, urging us to explore and discover more when we&#39;re coding as well! After all, every good programmer should have that curiosity and eagerness to learn!<br><br>Thanks so much for the tutorial!
thank you so much
&#39;&#39;&#39;Even this works for copying a file to another file&#39;&#39;&#39;<br>f=open(&#39;xyz.txt&#39;,&#39;r&#39;)<br><br>f1=open(&#39;abc.txt&#39;,&#39;w&#39;)<br>f1.write(f.read())

That&#39;s the type of doubt I have  &#39;&#39;why do we even need file handling as one could make a separate file and keep on copying it in code rather than analyzing that file and writing separate code for it?&quot;
Sir I&#39;m trying to settle in Artificial intelligence side, plz give me suggest to what could I learn for settle in AI

seriously ,,,now you are telling this .....now only god know what i have learned in the past 70 lectures .....damn
what is the difference between documentation and comments.. ultimately both help for the users to understand isn&#39;t it ?
You are the best when it comes to Java and Python. If you could also start with some Hadoop, Spark and Data Science videos, it will be very helpful for every programmers.
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thank"">#thank</a> you sir
initially i thought the video isn&#39;t working, but later got to know this time it was a RADIO session 😂
❤
Thank a lot, Sir
Lol I&#39;m already doing thia from 20th video i guess caz I&#39;m forgetting and i don&#39;t know that is called comments
Why do we need comment. 😀
You are changing my life, thank you
I will recommend to put this video at the start of this tutorial so learners should know about how to comment every single syntax if they want to comment. I tried to comment alot of videos, starting from video 2 until video 67 but didn&#39;t know what is the exact syntax for comment. thanks
Nice explanation...
I watch ads when came because you for us is far much there everything

Python for Beginners (Full Course) | Programming Tutorial,PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3,Telusko,#67 Python Tutorial for Beginners | is Python Compiled or Interpreted Language?,0BhSWyDEDC4,408.0,222762,5978,"
is python&#39;s compiler part of the interpreter?
Great explanation, thank you.
Very poor explanation
but who is responsible to compile python source code?
Why python is more usable than other languages?
Fantastic explanation.
very well explained to me!
This answer i serarch last 3 month, finally got it.
Awesome concept!
Thank you!
Thank you so much sir. I got brief information about how python interpreter work. Thank you so much sir.❤
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BhSWyDEDC4&amp;t=5m56s"">5:56</a> funniest moment 😂
is there any problem with c or c++ as interpretor in python was to work everywhere.means if c++ or java work in one machine does it not work in another cpu archietecture.
Thank you❤
this is just awesome!
Thank you so much!!!
hi
Mmmm dosa
all the information is available on internet but here you compiled all of them in simple words, thank you very much for the great explaination👌
You look like sucre from Prison Break bro 😎
Vera level🔥
&quot;As your machine changes, your CPU architecture changes....&quot;<br><br>How this will effect the code running on other machine?<br><br>Can someone explain in layman terms?
❤️
Nice explain wow
thanks brother
Great video. One question. Is Java also compiled and interpreted language?
But where would be the class file generated?? I do not see any class file with byte code being generated like in Java. Please help me understand Navin. Thank You..!!
Thanks a lot... And ur explanation make me clear abt this one
Thank you sir, watched a few videos of yours. Got placed in TCS Digital. Your videos are clear cut and to the point. Thanks a ton :)
The best course anyone can come across for python. Thank you for your efforts sir. Really had an awesome experience learning so far.
Thanks very useful information sir.<br>One doubt PyPy is in Rpython means implemetation using R am i correct?
Boss you are a 🌟
Happy Guru Purnima Gurudeb 😐🍫
But how can PVM know about the CPU architecture?please help
Inshort python is a hybrid language= (compiled+ interpreted) language.<br>Thank you sir for making us clear this concept ❣️
I literally thought of Vmware 😂
On enabling subtitles it shows your name as &quot;720&quot;😅
tq
😹😹 ...<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BhSWyDEDC4&amp;t=2m00s"">2:00</a> RIP to those who still thinks Python is a Scripting Language instead of a Full Fledged Programming Language with Scripting ability ..!
I appreciate how crystal clear and straightforward you made this. Thank you.
Must says after inheritance vedio that&#39;s the another one whom i got at once ...literally too much useful and well explained , I loved it and also.share other to.go throught it , thankyou bhaiya 🙏👍bbbbyyyy😊😊😊😊😊😊☺
Ah, but do you then need a virtual machine for the virtual machine? The VM is a software program too.
Nice playlist sir...i learned OOPs through your videos more clearly than my collage teachers taught me also it is due to your videos that i have cracked many written exams in Python....Thank you Sir
Sir can you explain about memory allocation in python sir
Nenu TELUSKOnnanu @NavinReddy. Thanks for the nice tutorials :)
Crystal clear explanation ....👍
most important info for beginners
It&#39;s interpreted because it&#39;s a line by line execution when you code each line gets executed then and there itself. For ex print &quot;hello&quot;  gets executed there itself all last when you complete all your coding and run that file using .py command it&#39;s called compiled
Both compiled and interpreted
How do I get the Bytecode of my python code just like I get binary executable elf file for *.c file using gcc ?
Is someone actively deleting comments here?
Telusukunam sir
A really good explanation <br>Iam satisfied ☺️☺️
The concept is power is realized after watching such videos <br>thanks a lot sir
Sir please make video on meta class in python
Sir please make video on meta class in python
Thankyou sir because the content i learned from your java and python tutorials made me to get a job in campus placements in TCS 🙏🙏🙏
shocked ...python too uses compiler :)
Great explanation in detail.. cleared my mind about Python...  thanks a lot
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BhSWyDEDC4&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> 😢😢
Sir I want to to appreciate for your dedication, sincerity, efforts and knowledge. For me you are getting your name in the history because in the present world where student who are interested in IT sector and need to learn the skills. Even all those websites like udemy , udacity , edx, coursera, alison, etc.. are not provinding the content what you are providing and if somewhat you will sell your course to this websites you will earn enough as any one will be attracted from the content even at the nominal cost.<br><br>At the end i appreciate for your content and your knowledge. Thanks a lot sir, thank you so much...
Thank you, wonderful explanation !!!
Python is Interpreted. Formally, all one has to do to run a python program is execute a python source file (That isn&#39;t compiled in any way) to run it, hence it is by official definition interpreted (Of course I know the official Interpreter works by generating an intermediate language while executing Python scripts, but it is still considered interpreted)
sir please tell me ,what is pvm already in every operating system  which  run  to help python code ???
your videos are just awsome,i saw your 2014 java video also and I want to appreciate you how much u change yourself. the way you are talking now it seems clearly how much you build up your confidence level. plz make new java video also bcoz in old videos ur voice is not clear. stay happy and motivated also
Sir I need a big help. Can you please make a video or give any reference on what type of compiler used by companies programming round for python, what syntax diff etc.<br>Sir I give an exam write the code but give an EOF error.<br>N=int(input(&quot;enter a no&quot;))<br>Please help me sir I am in trouble regarding this.
Wouldn&#39;t hurt to use a whiteboard
The VMs in python is like common language run time in C#?
Difference  between programming language and scripting  language  ?..please  explain in   detail sir...I&#39;m  exhausted to search it for😔😖
how to subscribe twice?
Amazing teacher I have 😍😍
My name is 720 in subtitles 😂😂
Whatever the implementation is, Python is interpreted in byte level. That is why textbooks are saying Python is Interpreted. Python only caches these byte codes only when we writes program into package or modules since we can see that .pyc file.
Who else saw the YouTube certification at the wall?<br><br>Kudos to you Mr Navine...
Binod
a good class
Thanks for clearing my knowlege
THANK YOU! Thats all i have to say
What is shortcut key to make multiple line comment with #
We don&#39;t get to hear it everywhere ♥️
One of the best descriptions/answers I&#39;ve found!!!  BIG thumbs up. But please... slow down. Had to change playback speed and watch it a few times to wrap my head around it. Thank you though. This is super helpful.
This is the best compilation/interpretation explanation that I&#39;ve ever seen!
Great Teacher...loved it !!!
Thank you for a really nice explanation!
So what are the list of language that use both interpreter and compiler for web? I like the fast development using interpreter(like PHP with just refresh browser) and when I am done testing, final build is to compile. I am looking for a new language to learn.
what the interpreter reads, is the instructions or the lines of the code?
I finally got the right explanation. Thank You
I have almost completed this series and kindly upload some more videos on database connection. This is the best python series in youtube
thank you so much
thanks a lot for clearing the confusion sir ! ☺
Such a nice and simplified way this was explained. Thanks so much !
So whats the difference between PVM and JVM? Can we say that Java is also a compiled and interpreted language?
sir my name is nagakotesh, is there any proof for python using compiler also
is c++  also complied and interpreted ?
so does windows 10 have built in pyhton virtual machine?
Really you are helped to learn python for mee sir <br>You are my best teacher not only youtube in my life you are the best teacher I never see the teacher like u sir
Are you Telugu
Clear  explanation, tq  sir

The position of an element doesn&#39;t affected whether loop variable starts with 0 or <a href=""http://1.how/"">1.how</a> is this possible?

Anyone tell me what is mean pos = -1

why do we set pos = - 1 as global variable anyone?
what do you mean by the n value is which is n?

My question is does binary search is better than index list method...?, why we have to use, although we index method..? Can anyone please explain.

Sir it not give last value of list is our required search. Plz answer sir
of this code there is no output generated
I&#39;ve an issue with this technique of binary search.<br>If the length of a list with odd numbers and we write code according to the technique that you describe,  I mean setting the upper or lower bound to mid according to the searched element is great or less so we&#39;ll reach to a condition where mid will be an odd index number which is 2nd last element and upper bound which is last element of list and when we find new mid so it will always give the same index which is 2nd last element of list and it will never be changed. <br>Suppose length of a list is 5 and we are trying to find the last element of list so there will be a condition where lower bound will be 3 and upper bound will be 4 and when we&#39;ll be find new mid so it will be <br>Mid = ( 3 + 4 ) // 2 = 3 and it will repeatedly give the same index for the mid.
When iam giving last element to search its not giving the correct answer it is showing before index
I have completed whole python course but still I was having problem with binary searching so here I am
The upper bound should be changed to u=mid-1 in the else part of else in while loop. Then this will be correct.<br>Since we need to decrease the upper bound to mid -1 when n is  &lt; than mid.
code crashes if you search for a number not present and mid is bigger than the search number!!!

code gives error when you search for the bigger number from the last number in the list
This code is failing when search for  last element of list
Thank you Navin sir for the explanation but I have tried to implement this code which you have shown it will not give correct results on boundary values logic of assigning mid value should be change like this<br>    if list[mid] &lt; n:<br>                l = mid + 1<br>            else:<br>                u = mid - 1
sir ,why position is -1
the shifting of lower and upper bound is so easy to understand, and here I was, trying to slice the list a bunch of times...
Totla Takla Chaman
Hi Navin sir, my doubt is, the code runs fine for any index position search if we do u = len(list)  OR u = len(list) - 1. Why is that?
Wait, does the return statement end the while loop? Because the condition raised at while always has to be true :/
so finally list must be in ascending order.
if we pass a sorted list to the function like(if sorted(List):) why it is not searching for the element?
Problem is , you are finding pivot only once , but pivot element will be searched everytime you did not find the required key.
the below code not giving output
pos = -1<br><br>def search(list_a,n):<br>    l = 0<br>    u = len(list_a)-1<br>    <br>    while l &lt;= u:<br>        mid = (l+u) // 2<br>        if list_a[mid] == n:<br>            global pos <br>            pos = mid<br>            return True<br>        else:<br>            if list_a[mid] &lt; n:<br>                l = mid<br>            else:<br>                u = mid<br>    return False<br>    <br>    <br>    <br>list_a = [1,2,3,45,98,10987]<br>n = 10987<br><br>if search(list_a,n):<br>    print(&#39;the element found&#39;,pos)<br>else:<br>    print(&#39;not found&#39;)

This is freaking me out, like why this is working, this shouldn&#39;t work!!!!!!!!<br>pos=0<br>def search(list, n):<br>    l=0<br>    u=len(list)<br><br><br>    for i in range(l,u):<br>        <br>        mv=(l+u)//2<br><br>        if list[mv] == n:<br>            globals()[&#39;pos&#39;] = mv<br>            return True<br>        else:<br>            if list[mv] &lt;  n:<br>                l=mv<br>            else:<br>                u=mv<br>    <br><br><br>list1=[3,5,7,98,100,345,6789,34556]<br>n=34556<br><br>if search(list1, n):<br>    print(&quot;found&quot;,pos)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;not found&quot;)
lst=[5,8,4,9,6,2]<br>lst.sort()<br>print(lst)<br>searchValue=2<br>low = 0<br>up=(len(lst) - 1)<br>for i in range(len(lst)):<br>    index = (low + up // 2)<br>    if lst[low] &lt;searchValue and searchValue &lt;lst[index]:<br>        print(&quot;lower&quot;, low, up)<br>        up= index<br>        low=low<br>    elif lst[low] &lt; searchValue and searchValue &lt; lst[index]:<br>        print(&quot;upper&quot;, low, up)<br>        low = index<br>        up = up<br>    elif lst[low]==searchValue:<br>        print(&quot;equal at position &quot;,low)<br>        break<br>    elif lst[up]==searchValue:<br>        print(&quot;equal at position &quot;, up)<br>        break<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;element not found.&quot;)<br>        break
why we did +1 and -1 in the conditional statements??
why we didnt use i+=1 inside while loop ?
def Binary(lst,n):<br><br>    l = 0<br>    h = len(lst) -1<br>    for i in range((len(lst))//2):<br>        m = (l+h) // 2<br>        if lst[m] == n:<br>            print(&quot;Found at&quot;, m)<br>            break<br>        elif lst[m] &gt; n:<br>            h = m<br>        elif lst[m] &lt; n:<br>            l = m<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;Not Found&quot;)<br>lst = [4, 7, 8, 12, 45, 99]<br><br>Binary(lst,45)
I really appreciate this video. Thanks a lot
What would one&#39;s do if you should to find couple numbers in list?
Sir this code isn&#39;t working for me.
Did he just called me an alien?
position=-1<br>def search(list,m):<br>    lower_bound=0<br>    upper_bound= len(list)-1<br>    while lower_bound &lt;= upper_bound:<br>        mid=(lower_bound+upper_bound)//2<br>        if list[mid]==m:<br>            return True<br>        else:<br>            if list[mid]&gt;m:<br>                lower_bound=mid+1<br>            else:<br>                upper_bound=mid-1<br>    return False<br><br><br>list=[]<br>n=int(input(&quot;Enter Total Elements: &quot;))<br>for i in range(n):<br>    elements_of_list=int(input(&quot;Enter Elements of list: &quot;))<br>    list.append(elements_of_list)<br>    print(list)<br>m=int(input(&quot;Enter Value to search&quot;))<br>if search(list,m):<br>    print(&quot;Found&quot;, position+1)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Not Found&quot;)
Great explation! But at the part when you run it and says at pos 5 dont you start counting from 0 when indexing? Because if you start at 0 and count to 5 you get 99 not 45.
Thank You !
One question..<br><br>list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]<br>n = 9<br><br>How is this algorithm searching this?<br><br>Because this is infinit loop here.<br><br>Don&#39;t you think your u should be lenghth of the list instead of minus 1?<br><br>u = len(list)<br><br>def binarySearch(hey, need):<br>	<br>	heyLen = len(hey)<br><br>	if heyLen &lt;= 0:<br>		return &quot;There is no hey.

pos=0<br>def search(lst,num):<br><br>    l=0<br>    u=len(lst)-1<br>    if lst[u]==num:<br>        globals()[&#39;pos&#39;] = u<br>        return 1<br>    elif lst[u]&lt;num:<br>        return 0<br>    else:<br>        pass<br>    while(l&lt;u):<br>        mid=(l+u)//2<br>        if lst[mid]==num:<br>            globals()[&#39;pos&#39;]=mid<br>            return 1<br>        else:<br>            if lst[mid]&lt;num:<br>                l=mid<br>            else:<br>                u=mid<br><br><br>lst=[1,2,3,4,6,7,9]<br>ch=11<br>if search(lst,ch)==1:<br>    print(&quot;found at&quot;,pos+1)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Not found&quot;)
it is producing infinite loop with a number not found in list. I guess with this logic it will never go to the last position. Should we keep one more check .. if the item is last element or grater than last .. before entering into the loop??.
this guy feels like he doesnt know much.
A great video<br>Something that helped me with my homework, thought it will take an entire day
bro naveen reddy - your explanation superb..!!
super square good
anyone can u explain why we want to give mid+1 for lower and mid-1 for upper.simply we are change the poistion from mid to lower only na.
Amazing
Thank you so much for this tutorial.
This is just amazing...
Is this a telugu channel ?
Sir last value is not printed
please make series on python turtle
tq
I am unable to fetch some values of my list though they are in the list but at run time it shows &quot;not found&quot; ?
is this ok?<br><br>les = [1, 3, 7, 9, 14, 19, 45]<br>res = 14<br>f = 0<br>l = len(les)-1<br>count = 1<br>while les[f] != res:<br>    f = (f+l)//2<br>    count+=1<br>    <br>print(count,f)
line 12      <br>    globals()[&#39;pos&#39;] = mid:        it is giving me this error can someone help me??
Great videos sir ! Only I had to point out one correction , I think when we relocate the lowerBound or UpperBound , it should be lowerBound=mid+1 and upperBound=mid-1 .<br>You&#39;ve mentioned it in later part though . For anyone having doubt with the initial part of video , hope this comment helps :p
can anyone tell me what&#39;s wrong in this program<br>def search(start, end, find, number):<br>    low = start<br>    high = end<br>    mid = low + high // 2<br>    if find == number[mid]:<br>        return print(&quot;your value is at {}&quot;.format(mid))<br>    else:<br>        if find &gt; number[mid]:<br>            search(number[mid], end, find, number)<br>        else:<br>            search(start, number[mid], find, number)<br><br><br>number = [44, 57, 24, 87, 68, 22, 55]<br>number.sort()<br>nm = number[-1]<br>last = (number.index(nm))<br>print(nm)<br>find = int(input(&quot;enter the number you wanna search for: &quot;))<br>search(0, last, find, number)

If user doesn&#39;t enter in sorting order. Then we need to sort the values right?
But.... Can&#39;t search the last value
You helped me alottttttt!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Very Nicely explained bro, thanks a lot, u made it very easy to understand, if u dont explain in the beginning if directly start code then i supposed not get it.
thank you for lesson you are really the best teacher

the best explanation on binary search
bro kha ki dher hori thi explain krne mei....????
You gotta work on your diction, often times it&#39;s hard to understand what you&#39;re saying.
The code doesn&#39;t work when you try to search the last element of the list.<br>            the corrections are:<br>            if list[mid] &lt; n:<br><br>                l = mid+1<br>            else:<br>                u= mid-1
But how we can implement this in string suppose if we have a list of strings and we r also searching for a string so will it work with strings as well.
Thank you so much dude ✨❣️ ! Your teaching is tons better than my professor
Another way to do Binary Search :<br><br>def binary_search(sequence, item):<br>    begin_index = 0<br>    end_index = len(sequence)- 1<br>    while begin_index &lt;= end_index:<br>        midpoint = begin_index + (end_index - begin_index) // 2<br>        midpoint_value = sequence[midpoint]<br>        if midpoint_value == item:<br>            return midpoint<br>        elif item &lt; midpoint_value:<br>            end_index = midpoint -1<br>        else:<br>            begin_index = midpoint + 1<br>    return None<br>sequence_a = [2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14]<br>item_a = 5<br>print(binary_search(sequence_a, item_a))
Yo this series is just amazing
what if my list isn&#39;t sorted and still i want to find its index number?
If you enter the first or last number of the list, the function does not seem to find the number. Therefore, I added a few more features to cover all the numbers. Please see below and give me your feedback. <br><br>def search(list,n):<br>    l = 0<br>    u = len(list) - 1<br><br>    if n &gt; list[u]:<br>        return False<br>    if n &lt; list[l]:<br>        return False<br>    if n &gt;= list[l] or n&lt;=list[u]:<br>        while l &lt;= u:<br>            mid = (l + u) // 2<br>            if list[mid] == n:<br>                return True<br>            else:<br>                if list[mid] &lt;n:<br>                    l = mid+1<br>                else:<br>                    u = mid-1<br>        return False<br><br><br>list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]<br>if search(list,1):<br>    print (&#39;Number found&#39;)<br>else:<br>    print(&#39;Number not found&#39;)

Eminem? Who?
why not just use nums.sort() ? is it just for practice purpose? or it has different uses in real projects?
I still don&#39;t understand how to Swep
List_name.sort() 😊😊
why are we taking the range in reverse order. Can anyone explain?
Thanks a lot you made it so simple ❤❤
my code is<br>def bub(l,n):<br>    for j in range(n-1,0,-1):<br>        for i in range(1,j+1):<br>            if l[i-1]&gt;l[i]:<br>                l[i-1],l[i]=l[i],l[i-1]<br>    return l<br>l=[2,4,5,6,1,0,12]<br>print(bub(l,len(l)))
Clean 👌
It save me the day to learn this in 10mins! Million thanks!!

Awesome
Anyone ans please while debugging the program why inner loop j value is 4?
Thanks a lot senor!
Can anyone explain what is iteration and how it works and y we took -1 at the end as a iteration
I did bubble short in simplest way <br>1. First I store the minimum value of list in a variable <br>2. Created a empty list.<br>3. Itterate over the list <br>4. Append the minimum value of list to a newly created list ( use loop )<br>5. Remove the appended value from the list <br><br>You will get all the items shorted without any hard and fast rule 😘<br>Coding is easy but the way we are choosing is programming<br>..<br>Problem of a program has many solution it depends upon your idea ( just like math )
bro which sorting is best technique in python and
Im dumb at coding so this is a life saver when I can&#39;t understand certain parts of the code.
You complicated a very simple thing! Why?
Can anyone explain for me these line of code from line 6 to line 8? It&#39;s seem not very clear to me  :(
I am searching for all the sorting algorithms in java telusko. But it&#39;s getting python... Can u provide the Bubble sort link in java. Now I became an addict of telusko java learning. It&#39;s really Amazing
def sort(a):<br>    for i in range(len(a)-1,0,-1):<br>        for j in range(i):<br>            if a[j] &gt; a[i]:<br>                a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]<br><br><br>this also works same : )
Super
We have covered swapping in an earlier lesson in detail. There we discussed 3 methods as I remembered.<br><br>So it is time to put that knowledge to work, without using a 3rd variable. (I learnt this from you)<br>nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]
easier code for bubble sort in python:<br>numb=[5,3,8,6,7,2]<br>for i in range(len(numb)-1,0,-1):<br>    for j in range(i):<br>        if numb[j]&gt;numb[j+1]:<br>            numb[j], numb[j+1]=numb[j+1], numb[j]<br>print(numb)
list = []<br>x = 0<br>for i in range(1, 5):<br>    num = input(&quot;enter number&quot;)<br>    list.append(num)<br>n = len(list) -1<br>for i in range (0 ,len(list)-2):<br>    for x in range(0,n):<br>        print(x)<br>        if list[x] &gt; list[x + 1]:<br>            Temp = list[x]<br>            list[x]=list[x+1]<br>            list[x + 1]= Temp<br>    n = n-1<br>print(list)<br>print(len(list))
In Fact,  We don&#39;t need to type complex logic:<br><br> for i in range(len(nums)-1,0,-1):<br>        for j in range(i):<br>            if nums[j] &gt; nums[j+1]:<br>                nums[j],nums[j+1] = nums[j+1],nums[j]<br><br>Instead we can type like this:<br><br> for i in range(len(nums)-1,0,-1):<br>        for j in range(i):<br>            if nums[j] &gt; nums[j+1]:<br>                nums[j],nums[j+1] = nums[j+1],nums[j]
why we are alien?
Hey well explained . But I didn&#39;t get range(numa)-1,0,-1 ?? What it does
i did it like this . it works <br>def bubbleSwap(lst):<br>    x, y = 0, 0<br>    h = 0<br>    while h &lt; len(lst):<br>        for i in range(1,len(lst)):<br>            if lst[i - 1] &gt; lst[i]:<br>                x, y = lst[i - 1], lst[i]<br>                lst[i - 1] = y<br>                lst[i] = x<br>        h += 1<br><br>    return lst
is it recursive???????
you explain WAY TOOO FAST!!!
Who tf you calling an Alien???
U r awesome
Please subscribe
thank you very much  Sir really, you helped me so much with this
you could also have a variable = 0 at the start of every iteration and inciment it by 1 when you swap, therefore if at the end of an iteration the variable is 0 means the list is sorted and you don&#39;t have to try to sort the rest of the already sorted list
Sir, you are the best teacher, but why do you tell programmers &quot;Aliens&quot;?<br>Pls explain
lsst=[5,8,4,9,6,2]<br>print(lsst)<br>for i in range(len(lsst)):<br>    for j in range(len(lsst)):<br>        if lsst[i]&lt;lsst[j]:<br>            temp=lsst[j]<br>            lsst[j]=lsst[i]<br>            lsst[i]=temp<br>print(lsst)
Sorting in ascending order....in python sort function enough to sorted
Telusko, you really deserve a thumbs up. DSA never gets easier than this!!!
can we use list.sort() instead of writing it?
Your editing and speaking skills are amazing.<br>Straight to the point and really showcases what you need to understand.<br>Good job!
Just outstanding. Love from Pakistan.
Sir do you have live classes for ds in python or notes kindly reply
What if instead of list, I used tuples, dictionary as a input data structures, so time complexity will remain same or change?
Sir , I can&#39;t get what&#39;s the use temp !
Hello ... anybody can can tell me in which language DSA is good and more comfortable..?
Yeh.. did it before watching ur code -<br><br>def sort(nums):<br>    for e in range(len(nums)-1):<br>        for i in range(len(nums)-1):<br>            if nums[i]&gt;nums[i+1]:<br>                temp=nums[i]<br>                nums[i]=nums[i+1]<br>                nums[i+1]=temp<br>            else:<br>                pass<br><br>nums =[5,3,8,6,7,2]<br>sort(nums)<br>print(nums)
For outer loop can we take range(0,len(nums)-1,1)?
why should we put -1in end part of the range declaration (starting)
Thanks bro this video is very helpful for me.  I am studying engineering Would you suggest some tips to enhance my coding and communication skills.
def bubble_sort(seq):  <br>    min_value = 0<br>    for i in range(len(seq)-1):<br>        for j in range(i):<br>            if seq[j] &gt; seq[j+1]:<br>                seq[j],seq[j+1] = seq[j+1],seq[j]<br><br>    return seq<br><br>is this considered as bubble sort, as in this the sorting is done by taking out the minimum values just like selection sort but with more iterations.
Here is a simple code::<br><br>class BubbleSort:<br><br>   @staticmethod<br><br>    def bubblesort(list):<br><br>        for i in range(len(list)-1,0,-1):<br><br>            for j in range(i):<br>                if list[j]&gt;list[j+1]:<br>                    list[j], list[j+1] = list[j+1], list[j]<br><br>        return list<br>    @staticmethod<br>    def Output_bubblesort(list):<br>        print(&quot;\nAfter Sorting List:&quot;,list)<br><br>b1 = BubbleSort()<br>list = [5,3,8,6,7,2]<br>print(&quot;Before Sortig List:&quot;,list)<br>b1.bubblesort(list)<br>b1.Output_bubblesort(b1.bubblesort(list))
Included 0 in the list but wrong o/p is coming [1,0,2,3,] like this it is coming why is it like this
If we have sort method<br>Why bubble sort then , <br>Where do we use the bubble sort?<br>Someone please answer
Couldn&#39;t understand the outerloop
Navin Reddy, you are my hero.
Your function doesn&#39;t have a return value.  The outcome was due to built in sort function
Finally I did with one loop.. <br>Num=[3,6,2,16,11,17,8]<br>Def sort(list):<br>     For i in range(len(num)-1):<br>            If num[I] &gt; num[I+1]:<br>                  Num[I],num[I+1] = num[I+1],num[I]<br>                  Sort(num)<br><br>Sort(num)<br>Print (num)
How we are getting the sorted values as we are not returning values from sort function?
This is perfect thank you
sir please tell me whether my this program is right or not <br>it is giving right output  but please check my method<br><br>def sort(val):<br>    for i in range(len(val)):<br>        for j in range(len(val)-1):<br>            if val[j] &gt; val[j+1]:<br>                temp = val[j]<br>                val[j] = val[j+1]<br>                val[j+1] = temp<br>    return val<br>n = int(input(&quot;Enter the size of array &quot;))<br><br>val = array(&#39;i&#39;, [])<br><br>for i in range(n):<br>    value = int(input(&quot;Enter the  value \n &quot;))<br>    val.append(value)<br><br>sort(val)<br>print(val)
please make series on python turtle
Btw there is no need to take a temp variable for swapping.<br>Python allows a very easy swapping method, just use:<br>num[ j ] , num[ j+1 ] = num[ j+1]  , num[ j ]
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vca808JTbI8&amp;t=2m10s"">2:10</a><br>8-2 hmmm.....
can someone explain why it is not sorting:<br>def swap(a, b):<br>    temp = 0<br>    temp = a<br>    a = b<br>    b = temp<br>    return a, b<br><br><br>def bubble(c):<br>    for i in range(len(c)-1):<br>        for j in range(len(c)-1):<br>            if c[j] &gt; c[j+1]:<br>                swap(c[j], c[j+1])<br>    return c<br><br>but it is working when i do like this<br>def bubble(c):<br>    for i in range(len(c)-1):<br>        for j in range(len(c)-1):<br>            if c[j] &gt; c[j+1]:<br>                temp = c[j]<br>                c[j] = c[j+1]<br>                c[j+1] = temp<br><br>    return c
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vca808JTbI8&amp;t=6m13s"">6:13</a> we can also swap by just writing a single line, i.e.,<br> nums[ j ], nums[ j+1 ] = nums[ j+1 ], nums[ j ]
What is Big O of that code? O(n^2)?
Navin can we do it this way? - we create a empty list and do linear search for the greatest value or lowest value and append it to the empty list and remove it from the original list .....do this a few more times and the original list becomes empty and the empty list becomes sorted....i tried and it worked so i thought commenting would help other programmers get different ideas on how to solve the same problem...
This guys should&#39;ve been our university teacher. He&#39;s so good in explaining complex topics. Thanks a lot Navin Reddy.
vowwww.....I never understood it i college but u made my life easy.
shouldn&#39;t it be:<br>for j in range(i+1)<br>but sir has written for j in range(i)<br>which means that if i = 5 then the value of j will be 4 instead of four ??
you could just put the list at beginning and then do your work without using def which confuses us :)
thanks mate
This can be done through the normal sorting method which u explained in the lists concept
is there any built-in function for bubble sorting<br>please reply navin
Sir I was having question <br>1. Why we use two loops ?<br>2. Why we use -1 for Len(list) ?
I THINK THERE IS bug in program, i am not getting outpu<br>i got output after using the following code....but sir you concept explanation was awesome<br>def sort(nums) :<br>    n=len(nums)<br><br>    for i in range(n):<br><br><br>        for j in range(0,n-i-1):<br><br>            if nums[j]&gt;nums[j+1]:<br>                temp = nums[j]<br>                nums[j] = nums[j+1]<br>                nums[j+1] = temp<br><br>nums=[5,3,6,7,2]<br>sort(nums)<br><br>print(nums)
He call us aliens 👽 😂😂😂😂.
Bubble stop. Start.
You can just say num[j], num[j+1]=nun[j+1],num[j]
I tried to import both module in one file<br>first I sort the list <br>then find particular value<br>it gives correct answer but position value is not coming right<br>can someone help me in tha<br>code is same as in video for both import file<br><br>from Binarysearch import*<br>from Bubblesort import*<br><br>list=[4,6,1,3,5,9]<br>sort(list)<br>print(&#39;list=&#39;,list)<br><br>n=9<br>if search(list,n):<br>    print(&#39;Found&#39;,pos)<br>else:<br>    print(&#39;Not Found&#39;)

THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR
If there is an inbuilt function to sort, then why. Use these algorithms???
Sir are u a. Telugu guy.. because channel name is telusko and ur name is navieen reddy......please create a channel for telugu students si 🥺🙏🙏🙏
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vca808JTbI8&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> lol what
swapping in this manner would more readeable and understandable     n[ j ] , n[ j + 1 ] = n[ j + 1 ], n[ j ]
what is the bigO time for this code ?
def sort(nums):<br>	for index1,value1 in enumerate(nums):<br>		for index2,value2 in enumerate(nums):<br>			if value1&lt;value2:<br>				nums[index1],nums[index2]=nums[index2],nums[index1]<br>	return nums
didn&#39;t say a word about its Time Complexity...!
why cant  we use range from 0 to 5 ? i cant understand the logic ?
Hi telusko. The outer loop and inner loop s range is a bit confusing for me.<br>I just made the range as simple and it works but IDK whether is this right or not!<br><br>def sort(nums):<br><br>    for i in range(len(nums)-1):<br>        for j in range(len(nums)-1):<br>            if(nums[j]&gt;nums[j+1]):<br>                temp = nums[j]<br>                nums[j] = nums[j+1]<br>                nums[j+1] = temp<br>        <br>    return nums<br><br><br>nums = [9,0,1,8,2,7,3,12,5]<br><br>result = sort(nums)<br><br>print(result)
This is a really good explanation. I  can suggest you to use while loop as well to break out of the  for loop if the items in the list are already sorted maybe in the 2nd or 3rd iteration. In that case you will not need to loop through n times.
while running the code you didn&#39;t call the function, you just used the built-in sorted function
why to make sorting so complex when you can do this<br>print(sorted(nums))"

Insertion sort tutorial sir ??
1) May I know why the outer loop runs till 5 and the inner loop runs till 6.<br><br>2) In this scenario 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th iteration is doing nothing. Which sorting will avoid unnecessary actions.
super

Thank you❤
What if a list have duplicate values?
thanks that I can say.
KIndly explain all programs with input variable instead of constants
Such a great lesson!
Sir can you please upload videos on other sorting algorithms
best explanation ever
When i entered duplicate value its not sorting?
Sir What if 5 iterations are not enough to sort the array as we have more number of values in our array and we are running the i loop only 5 times and we still have a unsorted array left at the end after the 5 iterations of the first loop
All videos are awesome sir. Outstanding teaching way.
can u please add DS playlist also because  we aliens can easily understand those concepts when you teach.
Extremely helpful! Thank you!
hear is a small mistake that is <br>replace the range(5) to range(len(nums)-1)<br>replace the range(i,6) to range(i,len(nums))
Its tough for me
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KjapFQNxUo&amp;t=7m25s"">7:25</a> - as I have understood, the advantage of Selection sort, over bubble sort, we have to do swapping LESS number of times. Hope I have got it right.
In second for loop  range (i+1 or i  and 6 y we to take)?
Sir how can i sort an int value in asscending of descending order not a list nor a tuple just ex<br>if i have  an int 1234 as a single int value then how can i sort it as 4321
Sir, Make videos of sql
Thanks for this great tutorial. <br>I wanna point to something, you&#39;ve missed an edge case <br>in case this : <br>list=[1,2,6,5,4,3]<br>loop<br>min_index=2<br>i=2 <br>swap<br>so here we didn&#39;t find a less value than min_index=2, so we don&#39;t need to do swapping <br>to solve this issue, we need to add a condition :<br>loop<br>min_index=2<br>i=2 <br>if i != min_index then do <br>swap<br><br>===&gt; first case we swap 6 times<br>===&gt; the second one, we swap 3 times
It is returning me none!!!!! whyyy I want to dieee....i&#39;m not getting IT😖😖

you need to speak even faster so that you do not understand anything at all
Video gets a thums down. Accent is too thick.
Sir, you almost cover all searching algorithm techniques but you forgot to make a video on the quick Sort and Insertion Sort algorithm. please make on it.

You should use j in range(i+1,len(arr))
I have a doubt...can someone help me to overcome it.....y we go for bubble sort and selection sort.....<br>  nums=[5,6,8,2,3,1,9]<br>  nums.sort()<br>  print (nums)<br>  This is also gives the o/p....it&#39;s simple then y we go for bubble nd selection sort..!!

tq
sir can you please explain the range...How we are taking the range in this case
very nicely explained
list[i], list[pos] = list[pos], list[i] ... This can be also consider as swapping right?
PLZ make a viedo on insertion sort....u guys are doing a grt job

for j in range(i,6):,<br>i dont understand why its just( i).  i think it should be (i+1), but still without +1 also it works. ??
I think there wasn&#39;t  much diff between selection and bubble sort both were of order of n^2

please upload a video on list comprehension and its use cases....
analysed the code using debugger and understood the concept. Love your videos, Sir.
Say the list [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2] is called list1. How would I sort list1 and keep list1 but have another list that is a sorted list1.<br>So list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2] and list2 = [8, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2]     (I need it max not min)<br><br><br>Also if you want to help me out a lot say I have a list of sweaters with codes and I need to sort them by size<br>sweaterCodes = [125, 233, 438, 456, 547, 322]<br>but the last digit of each code is the size ( I based sweaterCodes off of list1 and list2 to keep the same example )<br><br><br><br>I already created a loop to get a list of just the last digits of each code which would be list1. I&#39;m not sure how to sort list1, while keeping list1 and creating a new sorted list which would be list2. That way I can sort sweaterCodes by using list2 and list1 to find the index of the largest sweater in sweaterCodes, since list1 and sweaterCodes have the same index values, then sort sweaterCodes that way. I&#39;m stumped
sir please do explain us merge , quick, insertion,heap sort techniques too . please sir!
This can be a possible optimization :<br><br><br>def selection_sort(list):<br>      for i in range(len(list)):<br>            for j in range(i+1, len(list)):<br>                  if list[i] &gt; list[j]:<br>                        list[i], list[j] = list[j], list[i]<br><br><br>Btw, Great video Sir as always! Thank you!!
Liked your video but I wish you made the code completely dynamic, instead of having for i in range(5) have for i in range(len(list))
In Python you can swap by writing just <br>nums[i], nums[minpos]=nums[minpos], nums[i]
Teaching future Python users to use and conceive for..loops  as if they similar to other language&#39;s loops is instilling bad habits and poor reasoning that will hinder their progress greatly. In Python, for...loops are iterators not counters, and they ought to be understood as &quot;for each_elements in a_set do something on each_elements&quot;, not  &quot;for index from 0 to len(nums)) do something on nums[index]&quot; as in C language.<br><br>--------- Python code starts here ---------<br><br>def selection_sort(unsorted_list):<br>    &quot;&quot;&quot;<br>    A far better way that mimics the actual principle<br>    behind &#39;selection sort&#39;, that is sorting by selecting<br>    items one after the other according to an ordering<br>    function<br>    &quot;&quot;&quot;<br><br>    # (optional) work on a copy to keep the original list unmodified<br>    lst = unsorted_list.copy()  <br><br>    while lst:  # for as long there are items in the list<br>        extracted_value = min(lst)  # find the smallest value <br>        del lst[lst.index(extracted_value)]  # remove it from the list<br>        yield extracted_value  # outputs it on demand<br>        <br><br>numbers = [5, 3.14159, 8, 6, 7, 2]   <br>print(list(selection_sort(numbers)))  # [2, 3.14159, 5, 6, 7, 8]<br><br><br><br># the above function can be easily generalized to use any arbitrary ordering function<br>def extract(n, *, func=min):<br>    while n:<br>        extracted_value = func(n)<br>        del n[n.index(extracted_value)]<br>        yield extracted_value<br><br># Some examples<br>from functools import partial<br><br>reverse = partial(extract, func=max)<br>characters = list(&quot;Python&quot;.upper())  # in reverse alphabetical order<br>print(list(reverse(characters)))  # [&#39;Y&#39;, &#39;T&#39;, &#39;P&#39;, &#39;O&#39;, &#39;N&#39;, &#39;H&#39;]<br><br>import random<br>shuffle = partial(extract, func=random.choice)<br>players = [&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot;]<br>print(&quot;The first to be randomly chosen is&quot;, next(shuffle(players)))<br>print(&quot;The second to be chosen is&quot;, next(shuffle(players)))<br>print(&quot;And the last to be chosen is&quot;, next(shuffle(players)))
So i noticed that you sort by index when you assign minpos to I as opposed to nums[i]. Is it possible to assign i to nums[i] and sort it that way or does it have to be by index?
Is selection sort = insertion sort ?
sir could you make a lecture on insertion sort
That was well explained...May i know your qualifications Mr.Reddy!
This can be optimized a little bit as below :<br>The code for swapping logic  is always getting executed, This can be executed only if we really find the small number , else the existing will be as it is.<br><br><br>def sort(my_list):<br>    for i in range(5):<br>        min = i<br>        for j in range(i, 6):<br>            if my_list[j] &lt; my_list[min]:<br>                min = j<br><br>        if my_list[i] != my_list[min]:<br>            print(&quot;Swapping Logic&quot;)<br>            temp = my_list[i]<br>            my_list[i] = my_list[min]<br>            my_list[min] = temp<br><br>        print(my_list)<br>my_list = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]<br>print(my_list)<br>sort(my_list)<br>print(my_list)

Sir, Installed mysql but configuration option not showing anywhere like your video. plz help
Please add the important hint that the MySQL server name should not have any spaces or special characters and that the password should also not have any special characters. Saves a lot of time and effort later on. Such a buggy product with a bad user support. No hint at all about this while entering password and later got stuck with &quot;Starting Server...&quot;.
you have made a mistake. You should be on left side because all the functions are on right side which got hidden up
Thanks sir. The first part was very helpful.

For those students whose output isn&#39;t showing properly first install the correct packages properly. Download Pycharm community edition first then got to File then settings.

Hi Navin!!!<br><br>I just completed your series on python. Hurray!!!<br><br>As I was told, they said you become better as much as you practice! Now, I have written a Python code which receives input from user and perform some statistical operation on the values.<br><br>1. It process it and gets the frequency table (this table isn&#39;t so fine as I don&#39;t know how to to create a table with Python yet! So I had to be printing my results separated with lines<br>E.g | score  | Freq |<br>       | 12 - 15 |   30   |<br>       | 16 - 19 |   16   |<br>etc.<br><br>So when I have a large data size, the table becomes wobbly.<br><br>2. It calculates the mean, median and mode.<br><br>3. It calculates the percentile and quartile.<br><br>I am a beginner!! I believe this task will surely exist in a predefined module, but I just need to do something!!!<br><br>My main problem<br><br>I want to make this program better to the extent that I will be able to make it into a mobile app<br><br>I will really appreciate your contributions.<br><br>I will also like this post to go viral so I can have a lot of comments, criticism and suggestion to pick from thanks everyone!

Amzing Video! Thank you!!!
I was asked about this function in my interview
Sir can you make video on ML and DL topics like SVM, K means , neural networks like CNN , VGG17 etc…
Those are tuples not lists
This is brilliant, thank you so much!
Thanks for the nice explanation.
Hi can you make videos on pandas also
hi can u plz tell how to compress zip file of 56 mb to less than 25 mb
If we type dict(zip(x,y))
you keep referring tuples as lists
IDE seems to be PyCharm
Nice! Great! Why does this print an empty dict please? : <br>cities = [&quot;london&quot;, &quot;berlin&quot;, &quot;chicago&quot;]<br>temps = [32,30,28]<br>zipped = zip(cities,temps)<br>print (dict(zipped))
why take tuple only, you could have taken other dt as well
Perfect video on the Zip Function
The video content is so excellent, congratulations
Thank You
Sir....I felt packages in python  is a bit clumsy....<br><br>Pleaseee... Make this topic clear for us.

tq
He his one the best python teacher. I love your courses
Quality too high didn&#39;t understand anything. <br><br>Jk, amazing video thanks so much!
Great explanation sir
And for whom NAVEEN IS WORKING FOR
Your function should return a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain one item from the a list and one from b.<br><br>You may assume a and b have equal lengths.<br><br>Sir plz give me the answer
Thats why I love indian guy in youtube.
Hi sir I had doubt , before asking that ,  I want to thank you for sharing your knowledge with us. Sir my doubt is this the end of python class or we had anything more to complete it...?
Python&#39;s zip() function creates an iterator that will aggregate elements from two or more iterables.
Sir you are the best
Hi Navin  , Can you make video on how to return PL/SQL ref cursor which is out variable in procedure which needs to be handled in python. Actually I have a proc. which returns 2 ref cursors as out variables and takes 1 input but how can I take this data in list and display?

@Telusko - What video editing software do you use ?
Great Videos! one question: toward the end of the video you add Navin and Dell again, how would you go about adding them to the dictionary? because in what you showed, when running list/dict with them they disappeared
Thanks man

The most simple socket tutorial<br><br>Thank You Bro ❤
bro put your code on github bro
Great, i am getting nearer and nearer to socket programming!
Hey sir how can we create server/clients at WAN connections?
Besides for putting the necessary IP address in the connect function in <a href=""http://client.py/"">client.py</a>, is there anything else required to connect a different device to the server? I tried using a friend&#39;s computer but it didnt work
when we can using the differnt networks for client and server it not working i showing that timeout prob how can solve that .<br>i  want to send the images through internet with programs in an different network it means from anywhere ,tell me ur suggestion for this?
I liked your tutorial, however one phrasing of yours gave me headache: You described the return value of s.accept() as the client socket. This is weird and indeed wrong. I was thinking: How can the client c send stuff to the client, and why is it called in the server script? Puzzling. So I found in the documentation: socket.accept()<br><br>Accept a connection. The socket must be bound to an address and listening for connections. The return value is a pair (conn, address) where conn is a new socket object usable to send and receive data on the connection, and address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection.<br><br>So it is actually something like an &#39;extra socket object&quot; specifically for communication (send/receive) in that exact communication between server and client. Maybe you want to pin this or rewrite it in your video description, because it might help others who get confused as well.
You are the man!
You are amazing sir.
God bless this man

1. Practice / implement<br>2. Nurture your curiosity to alter the code your way and see difference in output each time and learn cruxx and holes in programming. <br>3. Explore and select domain to implement python. <br>4. Web dev - develop pages, make projects etc. <br>5. AI, ML, Data science - learn corresponding python libraries and brush your concepts through implementing knowledge gained through tutorials via small small projects. <br>6. Explore more yourself.... (I know this much only🙂)
Can one freelance after learning Python? <br>Thanks.
Please give my warm regards to all the team behind this valuable series. I learned a lot. Highly impressed with the way you taught. <br><br>I started from the very beginning of the playlist. From lesson number 1. <br>The view count of the Python lesson 1, as of today (2022.06.16) - 5,044,059 In my journey which took me a couple of weeks, I saw how the view count drops from lesson to lesson. In this lesson, the view count is 409,063.<br> <br>People want to be successful. But they don&#39;t do what is required to be successful. It is like a marathon. At the start, there is a huge number of people, but if you want to say you ran a marathon, you need to FINISH the race. <br>Just imagine what a wonderful place this world would be if more and more people become FINISHERS.<br><br>I have been able to finish the Python part in this playlist. But, standing at the finish line of this, I have to start another race, that is HOW TO MAKE MONEY out of what I have learned. <br><br>I want to step forward in AI and ML. If you or anyone in the community can suggest to me where to turn from here it would be a great help.<br><br>Once again a BIG, WARM thank you to TELUSKO team!!!
Sir can you tell me that who one not from IIT background .is learn phython.sir give me Ripley.
Can I do python after diploma get a job apportunity ?

Minha Rainha Pomba Gira. Maria Padilha das Sete Encruzilhadas. Vá até onde estiver (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) e faça com que ele não descanse enquanto não falar comigo, que assim seja, pelos poderes da terra, pela presença do fogo, pela inspiração do ar, pela virtude das águas invoco as treze almas benditas, pelas forças dos corações sagrados e das lágrimas derramadas por amor, para que se dirija até onde está neste momento o (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) e traga o seu espírito até mim. Amarrando-o definitivamente ao meu. Une-se espírito, que seu espírito se banhe na essência do meu amor em dobro. Que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) jamais deseje outra pessoa e que tenha olhos só pra mim. E que assim seja! Salve Pomba Gira Maria Padilha Rainha das Sete Encruzilhadas. Peço-te assim: agora. Gira vai mulher, girar ao meu favor: trazendo (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) para mim. Pedindo assim: ar move fogo, transforma, água, água e forma e terra eura e a roda vai girando, vai girando e a roda vai girando, e a roda vai girando, e a roda vai girando. Trazer (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) de volta o mais rápido possível para perto de mim: que não queira outra pessoa e que se sinta bem só ao meu lado. Que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) sinta a minha falta e venha ao meu encontro e me peça que nunca o abandone. Que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) (FALE O SEU NOME) e o (NOME DELE JUNTO) assim seja e assim será. Salve Pomba Gira, Salve Salve sete saias, salve suas irmãs, Maria Mulamba, Maria Padilha e todas as outras da falange. Salve sete saias, minha boa amiga, mulher de sete encruzilhadas das mulheres e dos homens. Salve sete saias. Minha boa e gloriosa princesa conheço a tua força, o teu poder, te peço que atenda o seguinte pedido: que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) não descanse se não tiver a certeza que estamos juntos. Que o corpo (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) deseje por mim e deixe-o cego para outras pessoas que ele não consiga mais vê-la como mulher e que outras mulheres e outras pessoas não consigam fazer com que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) não sinta desejo com elas, prazer somente eu terei esse poder. Que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) de vez de amar, beijar e abraçar outra pessoa me assuma em seu coração, afaste dele outras e outras, que elas não o desejem mais, também que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) procure a todo instante, hoje, agora estar ao meu lado. Que esteja com saudades. Que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) tenha a minha imagem em seu pensamento em todos os momentos do seu dia. Agora com quem estiver, onde estiver (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) você estará em mim ao deitar, ao acordar que tenha sonhos comigo fazendo assim com que me ame a cada dia mais. Se estiver dormindo que acorde com saudades de mim que sinta prazer. Somente em ouvir a minha voz (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) sentirá um desejo fora do normal como nunca sentiu por ninguém e que nunca sentirás. Salve sete saias. Minha boa e gloriosa princesa pelas sete saias que acompanhe seus passos, rogo e suplico que amarre (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) sete nós de sua saia e sete guizos de sua roupa para mim. Agradeço por estar trabalhando ao meu favor. Vou divulgar o seu nome em troca desse pedido de trazer (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) sempre comigo para que se torne meu e largue outras para sempre e fique só comigo e ainda hoje pense em mim e me ligue e retorne logo por não conseguir ficar longe de mim. Pois terá medo de me perder que venha dizendo que me quer sempre junto dele. Assim seja e assim será. E assim está feito. Confio nas falanges da Pomba Gira Rainha das sete encruzilhadas. Cada vez que esse coração mais forte ela se fará. Por isso vou mandar para os quatro cantos do mundo pedindo a mão que me conceda o pedido de estar com (FALA O NOME DO AMADO). Que os espíritos das falanges da Pomba Gira já estão soprando ao seu ouvido (FALA O NOME DA PESSOA AMADA) o meu nome dia e de noite. Ele daqui mais um pouco não vai comer nem dormir, nem fazer coisa alguma a não ser se estiver comigo. Confio no poder das sete encruzilhadas e vou continuar divulgando este coração poderoso. Porém não se pode voltar atrás, pois a pessoa quem pediu para amarrar amarrará. Jamais ele deixará de correr atrás de você. Confie e divulgue. Que assim seja e assim será. Amém.<br><br>Para a pessoa te procurar publique esta oração quatro vezes. Quando terminar, escrever na sola do pé esquerdo o nome da pessoa amada. Aperte com bastante força o pé e diga:<br><br>(FALA O NOME DO AMADO)<br><br>3x debaixo do meu pé<br><br>3x eu te prendo<br><br>3x eu te amarro<br><br>3x eu te mantenho<br><br>Pelo poder das treze almas benditas.<br><br>O sonho que tiver essa noite não deve revelar à ninguém

workon command is not working
you should have mentioned about selecting terminal as cmd by default vs code will open power shell, i tought in my system in vscode i cannot open the test vemv, searched google, asked GPT, no use, finally i observed that you had cmd as your terminal and i tried to see if i can open cmd in vs code boom, there it was and now thet test vemv works, but simply i installed django in my system
It did work 🎉 thank you ❤
Beginners mistakes:you should select command promt in terminal...not powershell<br>2)you should select python interpreter in vscode otherwise.....django will not work

You can easily cut any part in the video or re-create but this is your way of showing that we might get stuck and that is the lovely thing about you, you are not just teaching in flat flow, you are even teaching us about the mistake we can make and think to drop of this plan of learning coding, sometime we get stuck and it feels like leaving until we are full of passion and perseverance. Thank you bro so much!<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
your videos are made in such a way that , at the end we are left with no issues

For anyone who had the same issue as me with the workon command not being recognized, it&#39;s either because: <br> - You are on Windows and not in the cmd shell<br> - You are on another OS<br>For me, I am on Linux, so I used the command <br>    source test/bin/activate<br>Make sure you are in the right directory first.<br>Hope this helps someone!

lmaoo u funny
you are simply amazing sir!
I&#39;m really struggling with watch time, but I&#39;m not giving up! 
i did the changes according to your video but still I&#39;m getting django page only
Good explanation Thanks
path not found solution<br><br>new version update:<br>* we can not give any name other than &quot;templates&quot; to the folder inside which html files are to be located.<br>* we don&#39;t need to make change inside setting templates, instead just add the app name to the <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a> app list.
Great
whoever is facing template error can add the path &#39;telusko/templates&#39; in                                                 &#39;DIRS&#39;: [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,&#39;telusko/templates&#39;)], you can easily see the path used for home.html in homepage with this label name &#39;django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader&#39; under &#39;Template-loader postmortem&#39;

If you get an error at the home page saying TemplateDoesNotExist at/ then go to the <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a> file and at INSTALLED_APPS=[......, &#39;your_app_name&#39;,] (You just need to add the name of the app in the INSTALLED_APPS field)
TemplateDoesNotExist at <br>error
Navin in installed app we have to add &#39;calc&#39; otherwise helloworld not appears.....can you make some attention and add between some video about&#39;  &#39; import os error &#39; and &#39;templates does not exit error&#39;
&#39;DIRS&#39;: [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,&#39;templates&#39;)] it did not work, u have to specify the exact direction of templates folder ---&gt;  &#39;DIRS&#39;: [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,&#39;project_folder/templates&#39;)]

ERROR &quot;OS IS NOT DEFINED&quot;<br><br>If you&#39;ve started a new Django 3.1+ project and are using older tutorials or guides, it&#39;s likely to come across the following error on your command line:<br>NameError: name &#39;os&#39; is not defined<br>Starting with Django 3.1, the startproject command generates a <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a> file that imports pathlib rather than os on the top line.<br><br>The quick fix is to import os at the top of your <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a> file:<br># <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a><br>import os # new<br>from pathlib import Path<br>The better fix is learn more about how pathlib works and update your BASE_DIR, DATABASES, STATICFILES_DIRS, and other files to use the newer, modern approach.<br><br>                                     OR<br><br>In <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a> file on the top you will see<br>from pathlib import Path<br><br>add (import os) command above it <br><br>like this<br>import os <br>from pathlib import Path

Thanks pro Excellent tutorial;  I would rather name it {&#39;resultVar&#39;:res} to be clear for the student and not confused . Thanks
thank you sir
The confidence we get when you say we got the answer😃 (vs) The answer 🤣
Navin means &quot;New&quot;
5+6 is 11 not 8
For those who are getting errors when you use request.GET()/request.POST()  method in <a href=""http://views.py/"">views.py</a> , Use request.GET.get() / request.POST.get() instead ... :)
Syntax error in <a href=""http://manage.py/"">manage.py</a> solution
56 xD
Here while adding the 5 and 6 why the output is 8. We have get the result 11
Great explanation and love the energy and passion which you teach :)
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xBMAoDfydg&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> thousand times for this channel
Flow explained above SIMPLIFIED:<br>Here we need to enter 2 numbers, add them &amp; print result in new page.<br>1. In the home.html create a form to add 2 numbers home page.  <br>        a. Need 2 text fields to get values &amp; button to submit it. <br>2. Need a page to display the results (result.html) - create it.<br>3. Created a new page, need to register in &quot;<a href=""http://urls.py/"">urls.py</a>&quot;. <br>4. Now, page is created &amp; registered in URL&#39;s =&gt; now we need logic for it.<br>        a. Create a function to add in &quot;<a href=""http://views.py/"">views.py</a>&quot; which gets the response from &quot;home.html <br>        b. And return to &quot;result.html<br>5. Finally, in &quot;result.html&quot; receive response in a variable.<br>6. DONE.<br>Create  a page -&gt; register it in urls -&gt; write logic in views -&gt; receive in results.

5+6 is 11 , not 8...... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xBMAoDfydg&amp;t=7m06s"">7:06</a>

import error path not found.<br>How do I solve this ??<br>I can&#39;t make it to work but i used url instead still facing problem.<br>It works well with django.conf.urls import url<br>But when configured home with url(&#39;&#39;,views.home,name=&#39;home&#39;)<br>This renders home.html for all urls<br>-----------<b>*EDIT*</b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>All issues solved it was an issue with my python version I had two of them installed 2.7 for 64 bit and 3.8 for 32 bit<br>and all my shell command were using python2.7 which lead to installation of django-admin version 1.11 which doesn&#39;t have path in its documentation.<br>So I uninstalled the 64bit version and added 3.8 version to the path and reinstalled django.

How we will get to known the error of this website actually i am not able to see the error
hi I am very new to django. Just wondering we already put static files in static folder, why we need to ask django to create another folder &#39;assets&#39; to copy almost the same thing from &#39;static&#39;?
Don&#39;t you know about ctrl+d
Hey Navin - These are great videos, and thank  you so much to you and your team for sharing them here. All seems fine, just curious why the % symbol is being referred as a DOLLAR rather than referring as Percent or Percentile?
I think django developers should make this static file managing easier and clearer. This is so confusing, no wonder if the teacher is also confused.
thank you
I can&#39;t get my background image, can anyone provide the solution ?

For anyone who&#39;s not getting the BG images just mention static/ at the beginning of path everywhere
Problem solved!

Hi Navin! Thanks for helping us all a lot to learn Django. The way you explained is really good as any beginner like my self can understand it. <br><br>I am also facing some issue with theme integration in django. The error states like this <br>[&quot;does not appear to have any patterns in it. If you see valid patterns in the file then the issue is probably caused by a circular import.&quot;]<br><br>Can you please guide?

Bootstrap files are not loading<br>How to add bootstrap in django
Good Tutorials for  a beginner ! I tried to execute and got this error &quot;Refused to apply style from &#39;<a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8000/plugins/font-awesome-4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css&#39;"">http://127.0.0.1:8000/plugins/font-awesome-4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css&#39;</a> because its MIME type (&#39;text/html&#39;) is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.&quot; in inspect window. Any idea how to fix this?
if you couldn&#39;t display the change after applying all the things. then solution , you should add  app name to settings file(&quot;INSTALLED_APPS = [<br>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,<br>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,<br>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,<br>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,<br>    &#39;django.contrib.messages&#39;,<br>    &#39;django.contrib.staticfiles&#39;,<br>    &#39;trevallo&#39;,<br>]
Hi,<br>As soon as I write python <a href=""http://manage.py/"">manage.py</a> collectstatic. I&#39;m getting another files in Assets folder. Why Is it work like that? why I cannot transfer the same files which present in static folder?<br><br>Thanks
Hi. When you use the command collectstatic (min @) it just copy the files in static to a folder named assets. Why?<br>What is this folder for? Why you don&#39;t use it after that? What&#39;s the difference between static and assets folders?
Hi it&#39;s really useful 4 all people <br>, But one small doubt - WHERE THE PEOPLE CAN CLARIFY THEIR &#39; DOUBTS&#39;  if anyone get stuck while doing the things  ....... Sir it would be better of you take this also in mind ☺️ we are really looking farword to your response here ....!

how can i resolve MIME TYPE error
Refused to apply style from &#39;&lt;URL&gt;&#39; because its MIME type (&#39;text/html&#39;) is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.<br>Help please!
please tell me where we need to put {%static <br>i have put it where i got src and href plz help <br>thankuh
For me not all staticfiles loaded and some are not found
Sir question, when you already put the static files on the static folder then you edit the <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a> and then do the command with <a href=""http://manage.py/"">manage.py</a> collectstatic, <br>What if you need to edit your css file? Or add another image? <br>You’ll do the edit with the assets folder directly? Or you’ll add the new image or edit the css files in the static folder then do the command <a href=""http://manage.py/"">manage.py</a> collectstatic again to migrate the changes to the assets folder?

Awesome explanation Sir
Those who are getting 404 after doing all the changes, please rectify your <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a> with the video
I was getting error about custom.js so i found custom.js in index.html and there was &#39;%} missing <br>So if you are getting error in editing index.html :press f12 and see where you are getting error
Thanks for the explanation. The step by step debugging actually helped me here
I am getting Uncaught ReferenceError <br>is there any suggestions
The video was really well explained... thanks telusko
{% load static %}error<br>what is the problem to the my program: Space (don&#39;t worry)<br>solution:<br>follow this way {% static &#39; url information&#39; %}<br>usespace after {% ,<br>type static and give a space, and type  &#39; url&#39;, <br>and give space after single quote and give space <br>type%}

Tip to Aliens :<br>Dont create two objects for a single class in <a href=""http://views.py/"">views.py</a> and pass those two objs in return dictionary ,that may cause error<br>my experience:<br>actually i created the class called data() in <a href=""http://model.py/"">model.py</a> and created two objs for that in <a href=""http://views.py/"">views.py</a> and  i passed those two objects to the return by specifying two key values for both objects<br>that gave me a sleepless night then i found that error by trail and error method
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBn87eRFwo&amp;t=8m20s"">8:20</a> Dynamic image soure format src=&quot;{{baseUrl}}/{{product.image}}&quot; did not work for me. The format src=&quot;{% static &#39;images/&#39; %}{{product.image}}&quot; has worked for me.

print(&quot;I remember the day we met.<br>Too young to see the danger.<br>I didn&#39;t know the devil you were,<br>That you&#39;d fill me with so much anger.<br><br>At first you gave me comfort,<br>Numbed me from the pain,<br>But the light you gave me faded,<br>Brought blackness to my veins.<br><br>Your trap worked as always.<br>I am not the only one to fall.<br>So many friends forever gone now;<br>No one&#39;s left to call.<br><br>Dragged me to rock bottom,<br>Each day a life in hell anew,<br>Felt there was no possibility<br>Of breaking this dependence on you.<br><br>Every day I woke<br>With only you on my mind,<br>Desperate for your love,<br>More desperate for you to die.<br><br>Through time I saw you were evil.<br>I watched you steal my soul.<br>Each time I tried to get away,<br>You would not let me go.<br><br>Tried to scream and cry,<br>Eventually accepted my fate.<br>Everyone had tried to warn me,<br>And now it was too late.<br><br>Family and friends could never understand,<br>Couldn&#39;t hear my silent plea.<br>They did not want to see<br>The sick effect you had on me.<br><br>You locked me in a cell.<br>You made me freeze at night,<br>Made me deceive those I loved,<br>Made me live in constant fright.<br><br>Left broken, battered, and bruised,<br>My number of scars grew.<br>Both physical and mental,<br>While the number of wasted years flew.<br><br>Went through the motions like a zombie.<br>No longer did I see<br>Any type of future<br>In this world for me.<br><br>You erased any shred of hope<br>When everyone turned their backs.<br>Difficult to escape this dark hole and cope,<br>Impossible to defend against your attacks.<br><br>I knew no church, no God.<br>YOU, my ultimate power.<br>No way to know real love.<br>I was now a rotted, dead flower.<br><br>Then one day it happened.<br>Most amazing hope one moment brings,<br>And I decided then and there<br>That I would grow my wings.<br><br>No longer will you take from me<br>Like you have stolen all these years.<br>You will never take my life.<br>No longer will I cry these tears.<br><br>I will deal with the pain.<br>I will swallow all my pride.<br>I will deal with my life of rubble.<br>I&#39;m prepared for this difficult ride.<br><br>If it kills me to leave you,<br>Then I will gladly die,<br>Because with you I&#39;m only surviving,<br>And I have been destined to fly.<br><br>I will soar, laugh, and smile,<br>Will breathe my life once more.<br>I will go back to a time<br>Before you came knocking at my door.<br>&quot;)

thanks code with harry to explain this topic
ye video buhat acha hain mujhe isme list, tuple, dictionary ,set clear hua, only tuple immutable hoti hain set duplicate value rakh sakta hain baki sabhi duplicate valure nhi rakhe inke nottion thik se set{} tuple(), List[] and dictionary {}, sare non homogenous data structure ho te ahin main differents values, brackets and mutable and immutable mein aata hain
Dictionary = collection of  key values pair
mutations mein change ho skte hain

how to  run this calculator  like the calculator in our mobile phone.
well, I did it quite different. I did it as<br><br>a = 15<br>b = 12<br>c = a + b<br>d = a - b<br>e = a * b<br>f = a / b<br>g = a % b<br>h = a ** b<br>i = a // b<br><br>print(&quot;The addition of&quot;, a,&quot;+&quot;,b,&quot;is&quot;, c)
num1=2<br>num2=3<br>print(&quot;sum is +&quot;, num1+num2)<br>print(&quot;sum is -&quot;,num1-num2)<br>print(&quot;sum is ×&quot;,num1*num2)<br>print(&quot;sum is ÷ &quot;,num1/num2)

Sir hame string ko as an integers show karna hai python me, to direct integer hi kyu nahi likh sakte???
Day 9 today
Video number nine of one-hundred.<br>The video showcases the beauty of datatype interplay in python and why using the right kind of datatype is important. The conversion of one datatype into another is known as type casting and it has two types:<br>i) Implicit type casting<br>In this type of type casting, the type of the variable is changed implicitly (automatically without specifying) by the interpreter. Datatypes in python follow a hierarchy and the &quot;lower&quot; datatype is converted to a &quot;higher&quot; datatype if and when need be. The hierarchy of datatypes is chosen such that there is no loss of data.<br>ii) Explicit type casting<br>In this type of type casting, the variable datatype is changed explicitly (upon specification) by the programmer. This is done for various reasons such as data manipulation to achieve a certain objective or to perform operations on datatypes of two different hierarchies. Explicit type casting allows one to cast from a higher datatype to a lower one, something which implicit typecasting does not allow.

As a 11th class student i need a oneshot of python (basic), function, string, list, and a lot 🤣
Harry bhai the text I enter in input and the print statement both come in a straight line<br>What shall I do

thanks sir
in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvG-R-xXouA&amp;t=6m38s"">6:38</a> you can use this also x = int(input(&quot;ENTER FIRST NUMBER: &quot;) this will not allow to type strings
harry bhai i dont understand this video plz make a second video of explaining it more precisely plz
A = int(input(&quot;Enter your 1st Number&quot;))<br>B = int(input(&quot;Enter your second number&quot;))<br>print(A+B)

Day 10 of 100. This video marks ten percent of the workshop as we slowly but surely march towards completion.<br>To make a program intuitive to use, it must be able to interact with a user, that is why today we learnt how to take inputs from a user in python. All good programs cater to the needs of the hour rather than executing the same code again and again. Taking inputs from a user is the most basic method of integrating the usage environment in a program. <br>The input() function in python helps us achieve this. This function pauses the execution of the program when called and returns a string value entered by the user in the terminal. A string can be given as an argument to accompany the function call and the user gets prompted to give an input. This can be useful to let the user know that the program is waiting for them or what kind of input we are expecting.<br>The function returns a string but this string may* be type cast into the datatype of our choice using the corresponding functions necessary for typecasting such as int() float() tuple() etc.<br>As such we can make our program interactive.

Day eleven of one hundred.<br>Today we learnt about strings and brushed over for loops. (function only)<br>Strings are &quot;like&quot; but not exactly arrays of characters. Each individual character of a string can be accessed in the same way as an element of an array can.<br>Strings may be enclosed in a pair of double quotes, a pair of single quotes, three pairs of single quotes or three pairs of double quotes.<br>A string enclosed in a pair of single quotes can freely use double quotes inside of it without the need of using escape sequences and vice-versa for a string enclosed in double quotes. A string enclosed in three pairs of single or double quotes can freely use single and double quotes inside without the need of escaping them, as long as they are not three consecutive quotes of the same kind as we started the string with.<br>Enclosing a string within three pairs of quotes has the advantage than we no longer have to use the escape sequence for the newline character and can simply jump to the next line in the compiler internally within the string without getting an error.<br>A string can be input directly till it receives a command from the terminal using the input() function.<br><br>An interesting observation was that the multiline comment in python is also made within three pairs of quotes, the only difference is that this is not assigned to any variable. This naturally raises the question, does python treat multi-line comments as stray strings? That is, does python allocate memory for multi line comments, and simply skips over them so as to not interrupt the code?<br><br>edit: Yes indeed is the answer to the above question, all of the questions in fact! Multi line comments are also called &quot;docstrings&quot; or &quot;documentation strings.&quot;<br>The python interpreter treats multiline comments as normal strings and allocated memory to them, but since the strings are not assigned to any variable, the functioning of the code is left superficially unaffected, but deep inside the kernel the program requires more memory and more time to execute since it has to create a new (probably large) string object

The code `print(nm[-4:-2])` will output a substring of the variable `nm` starting from the fourth-to-last character up to, but not including, the second-to-last character.<br><br>   Explanation:<br>- `nm[-4:-2]`: This is a Python slicing notation. It extracts a substring from the variable `nm`.<br>- `-4`: Specifies the fourth-to-last character in the string.<br>- `:-2`: Specifies up to, but not including, the second-to-last character.<br><br>So, it prints the characters at positions `-4` and `-3` in the string `nm`.

output  will be &quot;ar&quot; since python will interpret it as [len(nm) -4 : len(nm) -1]  ==&gt; [1:3]
Out put in Har
nm = &quot;Harry&quot; print(nm[-4:-2]) this a statement. Print ar hoga because python mein indexing 0 se start hoti right but  last of index position per ek pahle wali count hogi it&#39;s means last wali index ko mention nahi karna hai

QUIZ ANSWER IS= AR
Watching this playlist from Pakistan. Your way of explaining is way easier and understandable than others. Your efforts and content are worth mentioning. You tell everything bit by bit in easy words. Thanks for teaching and giving us your time. You deserve a compliment. 😄
Answer : ar
output is     ar
nm=&quot;Harry&quot;<br>print(nm[-4:-2])<br>*The length of the string is 5, and the order of characters starts from zero, so H(0), a(1), r(2), r(3), y(4). <br>Back to the code;<br>(len(nm)-4--&gt;5-4=1<br>(len(nm)-4--&gt;5-2=3<br>*Hypothetically new statement is print(nm[1:3])<br>we know starting point is 1, but to access charater&#39;s order we use n-1 principal.<br> So, order of character=n-1<br>OC=3-1=2<br>Take order of character from 1 to 2 from the actual string; hence, out put is (ar).
Day 12 of 100<br>Here we learn how to slice strings into substrings. The technique will be particularly useful when we are working with large strings and string slicing forms the basis of string manipulation.<br>To get the length (int) of a string we use the len(stringobject) function. This returns the exact number of characters inside a particular string. (Question: Does it include null characters as well?)<br>To get a substring from a string by slicing we use the format stringobj[a:b] where a is the lower limit and b the upper. The substring includes the character at the &#39;a&#39;th index till the character at the &#39;b-1&#39;th index.<br>(Question: Is strobject[a:a+1] equivalent to strobject[a] since the former returns a string and the latter a char)<br>If a&gt;=b then the returned string is null<br>If a&lt;0 then we replace a by a+len(strobject) and b&lt;0 then we do the same. This is called negative slicing.<br>We also brushed over looping over a string using a character variable using the syntax<br>for ch in range stringobject:<br> statements<br>end<br><br>Answer to question 1<br>Yes, null characters form parts of the string itself hence all null characters are treated at par with regular characters<br><br>Answer to question 2<br>In both cases the return type is string even for strobject[a] hence it was said string is &quot;like&quot; an array of characters, not an array of characters.
Day 8 of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode"">#100DaysOfCode</a>.<br>Attendance: November 11, 2023<br><br># Quick Quiz:<br>nm = &quot;Harry&quot;<br>print(nm[-4:-2])<br><br>Output = ar<br><br>names = &quot;Sakshi, Dil&quot;<br>print(names[0:6])<br>print(names[1:5])<br>print(names[-1:-3])<br>print(names[ : 4])<br>len1 = len(names)<br>print(len1)<br>print(&quot;The length of len1 is&quot;, len1, &quot;letter word&quot;)<br>School = &quot;Imperial&quot;<br>len2 = len((School))<br>print(len2)
ar
# The Output of the program is: <br>ar<br><br>nm = &quot;Harry&quot;<br>print(nm[-4:-2])<br><br>start = len(nm) - 4<br>start = 5 - 4 = 1<br><br>end = len(nm) - 2<br>end = 5 -2 = 3<br><br><br>nm[1:3] #1 is including and 3 is excluding<br><br>H a r r y<br>0 1 2 3 4
answer is ar because length of &quot;Harry&quot; is 5 so if we subtract -4 and -2 from harry, we get 1:3 which gives ar as the answer.
day 3
Answer of Quick Quiz is Ha because print(nm[-4:-2) means print(nm[len(nm)-4:len(nm)-2] i.e. print(nm[0:2]  and the result is------- Ha
A r
ans of quiz = ar
Output of this quiz problem is &quot;ar&quot;

I was facing issue. As Harry told us that the code will give US time if we run it in replit, so we have to run code in VS code. But it didn&#39;t work for me. I couldn&#39;t find pdf from replit&#39;s id link. So, this is the code to get your local time in replit. <br>import pytz<br>from datetime import datetime<br><br># Set your local time zone<br>local_tz = pytz.timezone(&quot;Asia/Karachi&quot;)<br><br># Get the current time in your local time zone<br>current_time = datetime.now(local_tz)<br><br># Format the current time as &quot;hour:minutes:seconds&quot;<br>formatted_time = current_time.strftime(&quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;)<br><br># Print the formatted local time<br>print(&quot;Your local time is:&quot;, formatted_time)<br><br># Check the hour of the current time and print the appropriate greeting<br>hour = current_time.hour<br><br>if 5 &lt;= hour &lt; 12:<br>    print(&quot;Good morning!&quot;)<br>elif 12 &lt;= hour &lt; 17:<br>    print(&quot;Good afternoon!&quot;)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Good evening!&quot;)<br><br>In the first line, we import the `pytz` library, which helps us work with different time zones. Then, we import the `datetime` module, which allows us to work with dates and times.<br><br>Next, we set the `local_tz` variable to your local time zone, which is &quot;Asia/Karachi&quot; for Kunjah, Punjab Province, Pakistan (you can write your location). This line tells the code which time zone to consider when getting the current time.<br><br>Then, we use `datetime.now(local_tz)` to get the current time in your local time zone. This line captures the current date and time information.<br><br>After that, we format the current time as &quot;hour:minutes:seconds&quot; using `strftime(&quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;)`. This line takes the current time and converts it into a formatted string.<br><br>Finally, we print the formatted local time using `print(&quot;Your local time is:&quot;, formatted_time)`.<br><br>To write a program that returns &quot;Good morning,&quot; &quot;Good afternoon,&quot; or &quot;Good evening&quot; according to the time, you can use an `if` statement to check the hour of the current time and then print the appropriate greeting. Here&#39;s an example:<br><br>```python<br>hour = current_time.hour<br><br>if 5 &lt;= hour &lt; 12:<br>    print(&quot;Good morning!&quot;)<br>elif 12 &lt;= hour &lt; 17:<br>    print(&quot;Good afternoon!&quot;)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Good evening!&quot;)<br>```<br><br>In this code, we use the `hour` attribute of the `current_time` variable to get the hour component of the current time. Then, we use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to check the value of `hour` and print the corresponding greeting.
import time<br>spacetime = time.strftime(&#39;%H,%M,%S&#39;)<br>print(spacetime)<br>spacetime = int(time.strftime(&#39;%H&#39;))<br>print(spacetime)<br>if(spacetime &gt;= 17):<br>    if(spacetime&lt;=23):<br>        print(&quot;Good Night&quot;)<br>elif(spacetime &gt;23):<br>    if(spacetime &lt;12):<br>        print(&quot;Good morning&quot;)<br>elif(spacetime &gt; 12):<br>    print(&quot;Good evening&quot;)

Everyone is using the strd time module can we do it like this it is working for me currently. And if we can&#39;t use this can someone tell me why , what is <br>Wrong with this code...<br><br>import time<br><br>a= time.time ()<br>b=input(&quot;enter your name please: &quot;).title() <br>if a&lt;=12 and a&gt;=4:<br>    print (&#39;Good morning&#39;, b)<br>elif a&gt;=12 and a&lt;16: <br>    print (&#39;Good afternoon&#39;,b)<br>else: print (&#39;Good evening&#39;, b)
Honestly, so far it was going too good Harry, but since last 2 episodes mere dimaag ke uppar se jaane laga hai its not that i m not practising yaa me dhyaan de ke nahi dekh raha sab kuch but kuch chize ekk jaldi chali gayi ho esa lagg raha hai internet pe jo solutions hai wo sare ke sare kuch aur hi dikha rahe hai <br>I hope and i know practice ke saath hoo jaayega sab kuch and hoping aage ke lectures se shayad yeh sab confusion bhi solve ho jaayega and yes bhai sahi hai yeh wali 100 days ki series thanks for putting efforts

According to ChatGPT:-<br><br>The timing for greetings like &quot;Good morning&quot;, &quot;Good afternoon&quot;, &quot;Good evening&quot;, and &quot;Good night&quot; can vary based on cultural norms and personal preferences. Here&#39;s a general breakdown:<br><br>Good Morning: Typically used from around 5 AM until around 12 PM (noon).<br><br>Good Afternoon: Usually used from around 12 PM (noon) until around 4 PM.<br><br>Good Evening: Commonly used from around 4 PM until around 8 PM.<br><br>Good Night: Typically used when it&#39;s time to go to bed, which can vary widely depending on personal habits. It&#39;s often used when it gets dark or before someone goes to sleep.<br><br><br>Code made by using the above information:-<br><br>import time<br>h = int(time.strftime(&quot;%H&quot;))<br>if 5&lt;=h&lt;12:<br>    print(&quot;Good morning&quot;)<br>elif 12&lt;=h&lt;16:<br>    print(&quot;Good afternoon&quot;)<br>elif 16&lt;=h&lt;20:<br>    print(&quot;Good evening&quot;)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Good night&quot;)

It is like if else statement i do not understand the difference between these two
thank harry bhaiya. now day 16 also completed.😊😊
what is difference between the match case statement and if else condition
can we define a string value in Case? E.g; instead of Case 0 can we write Case &quot;A&quot;?
match case statement ki samajh ni ai bro

attendance day 16
I want to tell you that your lecture no 15 and 16 are not good because you haven&#39;t taught well. you haven&#39;t discussed the concepts clearly . you have skipped the concept of time module and directly give the question to the audience . you are knowing that they are so many students who are directly learning  python without any prior knowledge.

Present Sir 🤚
third value added every time in i when Loop runs print resultant value
This is done by third parameter - (start,end,step)
The range () function in python works by taking 3 inputs as parameters which are start_value, stop_value and step_value. The range() function returns an immutable sequence of numbers starting from the start_value, and increments the value by the value given in the step_value, and stops at the stop_value.<br><br>Ex. <br><br>for seq in range(1, 20, 5):<br>      print(seq)<br>Output:<br> 1<br>6<br>11<br>16

Thank you, brother. your way of teaching is amazing. very well understood now. thanks.
The way you teach is great...I always had a smile on my face..Thank you for your complete and excellent teaching.
range (x,y,z) means :   range(x = initial_value,  y = final_value, z = increment)
the loop start and adds the 3rd number<br>eg 1 (+3) 4
3rd parameter is a common difference between first and last number.
step is used in 3rd parameter for omitting the values
Adition &#39; its adding 3

Harry Bhai OP
Todays lecture explain us : (start,stop+1,change)<br>Like u want to start from 2, and end on 20 and you want that there will be change of 2 each
step is used jumping exp  1,4,7 you had written 3 in the step so it jumped 3 from 1

Sir aapki to insta pr bhut sari I&#39;d h konsi I&#39;d pr comment out kru sir
steps
in this range  we add 3 like 1+3=4 and the again 3 add and again thats it
the loop starts by 1 and plus that number which is after the second number and the number which is before it
Thankyou sir

Step is used to increment each iteration by 3 starting from 1 to less than 12 so 1,(1+3) 4,(4+3) 7,(7+3) 10
katva
what keyboard shortcut did you use to comment out?
Thanks for all this, but it would be super helpful for us and many if you would provide this with using the jupyter environment
Day 17 present Sir . <br>Love and respect from Pakistan
bro it prints every third number from 1 to 12, while start printing with one, and it did not print 12 becoz 10+3=13 but range is only of 12
Step is used for specifying the increment for positive count  or decrement for negative count<br><br>Example of  increment ⤵️<br>For i in range(0,100,50):<br>        print(i)<br>Then it will print ⤵️<br>                0<br>                50<br><br><br><br><br>Example  of  decrement ⤵️<br>For i in range(0,-100,-50):<br>        print(i)<br>Then it will print⤵️<br>                0<br>                -50

It shows error if you add 4 parameters
F(x) = { x : 1 &lt;= x &lt; 12, x+3 }<br><br>Only maths students can understand 😅😅
harry bhai you look so so similar to coldravendnest i swearrr
steps means its interval . basically its jumps what u given on third dimension
Range(2, 21, 2) The first number depicts the starting point of a range and the second number shows the limit of the range. The third number shows for how many times a number from the range will be skipped. <br>range(2, 21, 2) hence will print table of 2 till 20
It&#39;s giving a three blocks gap.
Explore about third parameter of range (ie range(x, y, z)) answer
# when we pass three arguments in range its mean range(start , stop , step) from where we want to start as we wish and step will increment every time which we want to do increment and stop where we want to stop.
Range parameters are (start, Stop, Step). So, loop starts with 1 and every iterations it Stops on 3rd parameter means (1,2,3) and then again starts from 4 and stop on another 3rd parameter i.e. 7 and it will go until it reach a value less than 12.<br><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a> Happy Learning !!!! 😁
why is one vertical but the other horizontal?? (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYVzKp0q5w&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a>)
Harry bhai... If third parameter is 3 then it is skipping 2 elements and printing the 3 element everytime within the given range
LOVE YOU HARRY BHAI❤

z is step and it is skipping steps

please speak a little loud sir!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is stepping in( int) function<br>Start inclusive :integer upto (exclusive):character to be skipped <br>For example <br>For l in Range (1, 13,1) <br>Print(l) <br>= 1,2,,3.......
Present sir🙏
Here are the loop prints the number, skipping from 1 to 12 by 3 each time. Explained in a simplest and in the least words possible.
Isme jb first time name mai Single comma ka use kia vo be without breaket
for k in range(1,30,3):<br> print(k+2)<br>if we are print like this so we are get esily table of three<br>and if we can print like this<br> for k in range(1,20,2):<br> print(k+1) <br>so we can print table 2
Why you use i it gives letters in different lines and when used color it gives word in same line
this is simple interval logic"

The loop starst from 1 then it prints the 3 number and it leaves the third number and prints 4 ,likewise it iterates every third number between 1 to 12
if we write &quot; i=+1&quot; what is this means, my program kept running but it was just printing 1??

good
can anyone please tell me what is the purpose of the else statement after the while loop? Because even if we have a normal print statement outside the loop, we&#39;ll get the same result.

hey ...that hack about getting rid of ants using a while loop  ... ! truly genius bro !
Guys someone help me pls. <br>Lennys program will adjust the difficulty based on the users Heartrate on a loop. If their heart rate is above 140 then the difficulty will decreased by 1. If their heart rate is below 90 then the difficulty will increase by 1, up to a maximum of 50 in addition if the users heart rate ever goes higher than 160 then the difficulty will be set to 0 and a warning message will be displayed. <br>HELP GUYS
Cpu ki dust saaf krni hai to infinite while loop chalado
do..while is a loop in which a set of instructions will execute at least once (irrespective of the condition) and then the repetition of loop&#39;s body will depend on the condition passed at the end of the while loop. It is also known as an exit-controlled loop.

Harry bhaia Zindabad
in the first exmple....while(98&lt;=38) the condition is false if false then how 98 is being printed and then terminating...if the condition satisfies only the i value can be printed right?<br>Can anyone help me with this
According to while loop if the condition is false it immediately terminates out of the loop...but in the first example even if the condition is not satisfied the value is being printed and then it is terminated...Anyone could u please explain
once we created a variable named &quot;coun&quot;t outside while loop and stored a integer and then how we can redefine the same named-variable as in this case count=count-1 again redefined.<br>I didn&#39;t understand this thing.<br><br>please help someone..

Hey Harry Vai Check Out This Code:<br>n = int(input(&quot;Enter The Number: &quot;))<br>while n != 1:<br>       if n % 2 == 0:<br>             n = n // 2 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23floor"">#floor</a> division<br>             print(n)<br>       else:<br>              n = 3*n+1<br>              print(n)

Count waale me straight away else execute hoga, kyunki - value badti rahegi aur aise loop condition meet nahi hogi to sidha else execute hoga.

Else  hoga
In case of decrementing while loop where we don&#39;t need to print 0 we can simply write --- <br>while i :<br>    print(i)<br>    i = i-1<br>in case of C,we could write<br>while(i--){<br>    printf(&quot;%d&quot;,i);<br>}<br>Given we need to initialize i as 6 instead of 5

If you have mentioned that this playlist is for beginners then you should create a content which helps for beginners. Means that, if beginners comes here and learn the python from your playlist then he or she might loose the opportunity to build the basic logics in programming. You are just dumping your code and explaining the code directly with little examples and saying practice make man prefect. . Conclusion is that please explain small small things properly so that beginners should not go to others videos after watching your playlist. If it so then there is no sense of making this course.

Today I Learned About Geometric Mean and About Functions.. Keyword=def<br>Ex:- tuple,title,index,etc<br>I Love Your Vids.
Yup, I Understand
Binod 👍
I&#39;m present.
Kisne GE mai python li h 😂
Smjh mei aa gy
wow it&#39;s Day 20 😋🥰🤖🤖🤖🦄🦄🪄🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊
geometric mean wrong formula used btw..............though amazing content
Yes bhai understand we note 😊
samaj aa rha he thanku bhai
I get it, functions use the custom values.
Awesome 🎉

Thank you very much I have computer exam coming up and I was not there in most of the clases😊
return() kaha hai
bhai iskehn baisc kam toh smj mai aa gayh but jaabhi bhi kisei bhi coding seh realted koi question aata hai ptaah ni brain puri trah khali kyun ho jata hai bhai please solution btaah do 🥲
I created the function of creating tables, now its easy ,you can call it for every number<br><br><br>def CreateTable(a):<br>    <br>    print(&quot;The Table of &quot;+str(a) + &quot; is following&quot;)<br>    for i in range(10):<br>    <br>     print(str(a)+&quot; * &quot; + str(i+1) + &quot; = &quot; + str(a * (i + 1)))<br><br>a=int (input(&quot;Please Enter your Number: &quot;))<br><br>    # Calling the function<br>CreateTable(a)
Maza aa raha hai

We also simply add the if,else command in functions:- So, We can&#39;t write both times.<br><br>def calculategmean(a,b):<br>    mean=(a*b)/(a+b)<br>    print(mean)<br>    if(a&gt;b):<br>        print(&quot;First Number is Greater&quot;)<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;Second one is Greater or Equal&quot;)<br><br>a=9<br>b=8<br>calculategmean(a,b)<br><br>c=5<br>d=74<br>calculategmean(c,d)<br><br>Solution is:-<br><br>4.235294117647059<br>First Number is Greater       <br>4.6835443037974684<br>Second one is Greater or Equal

Return matlab vapas lejao value lekar
return ka matlab: wapis chale jao is value ko le k
Return mtlb vapas chle jaao us value ko lekr
You are awesome harryyyyyyy
agar function definition ma more than 1 return statement likha hai toh program 1st wala return ko accept karke wapas chala jayega
function ke ander return ka matlab usko jo value mili hogi return statement ke doran woh value wapas leke chala jayega function ke bahar samjha

List methods:<br>1. l.sort will sort it in ascending order.<br>2. l.sort(reverse=True) will sort it in descending order<br>3.l.reverse() reverses the list<br>4.l.index( ) gives the first index of an instance present in a list<br>5.l.count() gives the total number of a particular instances present in a list.<br>6.l.copy() copies the list<br>7.l.append() adds the given argument to the end of the list.<br>8.l.insert() adds the given argument at the given index position<br>9. l.append() adds the provided list to the existing list.<br>10. you can concatonate two lists by simply a+b

Day5 of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode"">#100DaysOfCode</a>. Today in this video 23, I learned about various list methods in Python, including sort(), reverse(), index(), count(), copy(), append(), insert(), and extend(). These methods help in sorting lists, reversing their order, finding the index or count of an item, creating a copy of the list, appending items, inserting items at specific indexes, and extending a list with another collection datatype. Additionally, I learned that we can concatenate two lists to join them together. These methods make list manipulation in Python more efficient and convenient.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.
what is difference between extend and concatenating of list methods.

Hi !<br>Can anyone tell me how to create an &quot;int &quot; if I add more than 1 number it transforms into a tuple !!<br>Heres the code : <br><br>tup = (1 , 2 , 3)<br>str = (&quot;Hello how are you ?&quot;)<br>list = [4 , 5 , 6]<br>int = (7, 8, 9)<br>print(type(tup), &quot;This is a tuple &quot;)<br>print(type(str), &quot;This is a string&quot;)<br>print(type(list), &quot;This is a list&quot;)<br>print(type(int), &quot;This is an Integer &quot;)

Hey Harry i have a question can we use sort method in tuple??
im present sir
#24 100DayOfpython Challenge
1.When we want to make a constant, then tuple is used.<br>2., is added if 1 item tuple is made.<br>3.Tuples are ordered collection of data items. <br>4.They store multiple items in a single variable. <br>5.Tuple items are separated by commas and enclosed within round brackets (). <br>6.Tuples are unchangeable meaning we can not alter them after creation.<br>7.Tuples can be sliced similar to lists but new tuple is created in the process.<br>8. Tuples and strings both are immutable.
I&#39;m present!
Thanku bhaiya❤
Day 5 of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode"">#100DaysOfCode</a>. Today in this video 24, I learned about Python tuples, which are ordered, unchangeable collections of data items. Tuples use round brackets () and support positive and negative indexing, as well as checking for items using the &#39;in&#39; keyword. I can also access items within a specific range or print alternate values using start, end, and jump index parameters. Tuples offer an efficient way to store multiple items in a single variable, while maintaining their order and immutability.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.

Hi Harry, Firstly thanks for the tutorial I am currently on #24 and planning to complete the playlist in the next couple of weeks.<br>I have a question here. You said tuples are immutable; Once we create it we cannot change it.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23create"">#Create</a> a tuple tup<br>tup = (1,2)<br>tup1= (3,4,5,6,7)<br>tup= tup[1:2] # tup which was earlier (1,2) now it got changed to (4,5). But my understanding was once you create any tuple it cannot be changed for the entire program.

1Tuple has to be changed to list for changes and then back to tuple. <br>2. t.count() counts the number of instances inside tuple.<br>3. t.index() gives the first index of an occurrence. Start of search and end of search can also be given to index function.<br>4. all functions of list are valid for tuples
Day6 of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode"">#100DaysOfCode</a>. Today in this video 25,  I learned that tuples are immutable, so to add, remove, or change their items, I need to first convert them to a list, manipulate the list, and then convert it back to a tuple. I also discovered that tuples can be directly concatenated without conversion. Additionally, I explored two built-in tuple methods: count() to find the number of occurrences of an element, and index() to find the first occurrence of an element. It was interesting to understand the unique features and limitations of tuples.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.

sir time module kya hota h
Time = time.strftime(&#39;%H:%M:%S&#39;)<br>th = int(time.strftime(&#39;%H&#39;)) # th = time in Hours <br><br>if (th &gt;= 6 and th &lt; 12):<br>    <br>    print(&quot;GOOD MORNING SIR&quot;)<br><br>elif (th &gt;= 12 and th &lt; 16):<br>   <br>    print(&quot;GOOD AFTERNOON SIR&quot;)<br><br>elif (th &gt;= 16 and th &lt; 20):<br>  <br>    print(&quot;GOOD EVENING SIR&quot;)<br><br>else:<br>    print(&quot;GOOD NIGHT SIR&quot;)
it will never print Good Night Sir because you put a condition that it hour is greater than 17 so its means it will never be less than 17 or 0.but you but another condition that it should be less than 0. so both of the condition will never bi correct at a time so due to And operator it will no work
Harry bhai abhi time module padha nahi str function nahi padha to itne ache se smajh nhi Aya ye

Day6 of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode"">#100DaysOfCode</a>. Today in this video 26, I learned how to create a Python program that greets me with &quot;Good Morning,&quot; &quot;Good Afternoon,&quot; or &quot;Good Evening&quot; based on the current hour. I used the time module and its strftime() function to obtain the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. This exercise taught me the importance of tailoring program outputs to real-world conditions, and I gained valuable experience in using Python&#39;s built-in modules to access and manipulate time data.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.

Practice Questions for this exercise:<br><br>1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.<br>2. Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user for the length and width, then display the result using an f-string.<br>3. Develop a simple currency converter program. Ask the user for an amount in USD and convert it to euros using a fixed conversion rate. Display the result using an f-string.<br><br>thanks,<br>faceSense
with the help of the f-string why i cant able to print time<br>please execute this code <br>import time <br>port time<br>timeStamp = time.strftime()<br>print(f&quot;{timeStamp: %H: %M: %S}&quot;)

txt = &quot;For only {price:.2f} dollars!&quot;<br>print(txt.format(price = 49))<br>why we couldnt do print(txt.format(price)) ?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixmxgUf8yIg&amp;t=7m37s"">7:37</a> But Harry Bhai, if we want to print the string as it is without replacing the identifiers with corresponding values, we could simply remove that <b>&quot;f&quot;</b> before the string which will turn the f-string into a normal string

f string means that now variable can be inserted into string. f &quot; my name is{ name }&quot;.     name=&quot;sohail&quot;   {{name}} allow it to print as it is
Day6 of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode"">#100DaysOfCode</a>. Today in this video 28, I learned about string formatting in Python using the format method and f-strings. The format method allows for more precise control over the formatting, such as specifying the number of decimal places. F-strings, introduced in PEP 498, provide a convenient way to embed Python expressions directly inside string literals for formatting. By prefixing a string with &#39;f&#39;, it becomes an f-string, making it easier to interpolate variables and expressions.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.

Please someone tell me harry bhaiya ne kis video me repl use karna sikhaya..... btaya kisme ki unke replit ko kaise accesss kare
Harry it would have been better if u had given us the KBC exercise after teaching us all the extras stuff to make life easier ... i spent 3 days making 200 lines of codes banging my head on the keyboard on how to make KBC program more advanced than simple and every step i fucked up but anyways it was practice none the less

Day 7 of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode"">#100DaysOfCode</a>. Today in this video 29, I delved into Python docstrings, which are string literals that follow the definition of a function, method, class, or module. They serve as documentation for our code and can be accessed using the &#39;__doc__&#39; attribute. I also explored the differences between Python comments and docstrings. Furthermore, I learned about PEP 8, a guide for Python coding style, and The Zen of Python, which outlines the guiding principles for Python&#39;s design.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.
code is here :-<br><br><br><br>def wish(name):<br>    print(&quot;Hello to the game Mr {}&quot;.format(name))<br><br>a = input(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;)<br>wish(a)<br><br>def Quiz(question, answer, prize1, prize2, prize3):<br>    c1 = input(question[0])<br>    if c1.lower() == answer[0].lower():<br>        print(&quot;Correct answer and you won {} $&quot;.format(prize1))<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;Wrong answer&quot;)<br><br>    c2 = input(question[1])<br>    if c2.lower() == answer[1].lower():<br>        print(&quot;Correct answer and you won {} $&quot;.format(prize2))<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;Wrong answer&quot;)<br><br>    c3 = input(question[2])<br>    if c3.lower() == answer[2].lower():<br>        print(&quot;Correct answer and you won {} $&quot;.format(prize3))<br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;Wrong answer&quot;)<br><br>question = [&quot;What is the capital of India? &quot;, &quot;What color is an apple? &quot;, &quot;Which team won IPL in 2022? &quot;]<br>answer = [&quot;Delhi&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Gujarat Titans&quot;]<br>prize1 = 1000<br>prize2 = 2000<br>prize3 = 3000<br><br>Quiz(question, answer, prize1, prize2, prize3)

1. Sets are collection of well defined data type.<br>2. Set in python is made by { }<br>3. all functions of list are applicable to sets<br>4. sets and lists are different in only that a set does not allow repetition of same entry while in list you can repeat the same item.<br>5. Empty set is made by Emptyset= ( ) instead of { }<br>6. There is no guaranttee of order being maintained by Python within a set so output can change every time. (bummer)<br>7. To get items you can use for loop just like a list.<br><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
We can also make an empty set:<br>a = {&quot; &quot;}<br>print(type(a))
s={&quot; &quot;}<br>print(type(s))<br><br>This is also giving empty set.

you can also make an empty set p = {&quot; &quot;} <br>                                                          print(type(p))<br>like this. This will be an empty set
sir agr {0} likhan to bhi set hi milta ha

In this video lecture, we learnt about set datatype which is very similar to lists, but it is immutable, does not allow duplicate values, can not access set elements using indexing or slicing like lists, most importantly, sets are unordered. It&#39;s like a JHOLA(BAG) in which there is no guarantee to get the elements in the same order each time. To create a empty set set() method is used. a={} creates empty dictionary, not empty set.
This is also a set<br>s={()}<br>print(type(s))

Another method to make empty set is I think so ,{()},is this correct
sets are unordered, with no duplication and cannot be updated. They are defined by { }

Hello Harry Bhai, I have a doubt when try to declare <br>set1 ={1,2,3,True}<br>print(set1) # prints {1,2,3} omits True value<br>Similarly if <br>set2={True,1,2,3}<br>print(set2) # prints {True,2,3} omits 1<br>As it seems 1 and True are treated as same similar 0,1 for false and true is it a bug in python 3.11.2 or this is the limitation?<br>Thanks.
Now I came back after 2 weeks because my final exam , this after I will definitely consistent

for printing the type of the set is not working we have to declare the value none in curly braces like this :<br>harry ={None}<br>print(type(harry)) <br>where sir uses this type :<br><br>harry =set{}<br>print(type(harry)<br>where it shows syntax error in the vs code"

MONEY HIEST characters😅 all names😂
it is math concept of 11th class
this was a long one.
i tried multiple times but i think the pop function is giveing me the first value of the set every single time. infact i do not mix different types of values, the order is being maintained.
Sir! I can&#39;t print the type of empty set in python.<br>It is Showing an error.<br>set = set()<br>print(type(set)).<br><br>I am using VS Code
In, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOrutCnp2zo&amp;t=11m12s"">11:12</a> he said add but in day 31 he said set can not change
ok bhai
sir are the set methods applicable on list ?
Money Heist 😁😁
Harry bhai India m sbse jada kon se language use hoti h Java ,python,c++ kon si

The method related to sets are:-<br>1) union()----&gt;creates a new set with the unique elements from both the sets<br>2)update()-----&gt;applied on a set itself and it also adds unique elements from the both the sets into one of the sets<br>3) intersection()----&gt; creates a new set with the common elements from both the sets<br>4)intersection_update()------&gt; applied on a set itself and it also contains the common elements from both the sets<br>5)symmetric_difference--------&gt; creates a new set with the elements from the both the sets that are not common in between<br>6)symmetric_difference_update-------&gt; applied on a set itself and it contains elements from the sets that are not common inj between<br>7)difference------&gt; creates a new set with the elements from a single set that are not common <br>8) difference_update-----&gt; applied on a set itself and contains elements of a set that are not common<br><br>9)isdisjoint()----&gt;checks if there are common elements between two sets<br>10)issuperset----&gt; checks if a set is a superset of another set<br>11) issubset-----&gt; checks is a set is subset of another set<br>12)add------&gt; to add a element into a set<br>13) remove-------&gt; to remove an elements from a set, but raises key error if the element is not present in the set<br>14) discard-----&gt; to remove an element from a set, does not raises error if the lement is not present in the set<br>15) del------&gt; not method, a keyword, to delete the complete set<br>16) clear-------&gt; to clear all the elements of a set <br>17) in keyword used to check if a element is present in the set or not<br>18) pop()-----&gt; to remove a random element from the set and also we can get that element

A DOUBT!!<br>As we know that set is unchangeable. So how can we perform add(), update(), etc functions on it?
we can use set() constructor for sets..

u said sets are unchangeable. but the update method seems to change a set...pls clarify.
Sir aapne bola ki set immutavle hai then why we use add and upadate function in it...ab toh mutable ho ja rha hai n 🙄🙄

Present from Bangladesh Brother....<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23day32"">#Day32</a> Done<br><br>In Python, a set is a collection of unique elements. Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.<br><br>Here are some common methods that you can use with sets in Python:<br><br>add(): Adds an element to the set<br>clear(): Removes all the elements from the set<br>copy(): Returns a copy of the set<br>difference(): Returns the difference between two or more sets as a new set<br>difference_update(): Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set<br>discard(): Removes an element from the set if it is present<br>intersection(): Returns the intersection of two sets as a new set<br>intersection_update(): Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified sets<br>isdisjoint(): Returns True if two sets have a null intersection<br>issubset(): Returns True if another set contains this set<br>issuperset(): Returns True if this set contains another set<br>pop(): Removes and returns an arbitary set element. Raise KeyError if the set is empty<br>remove(): Removes an element from the set. If the element is not present, raises a KeyError<br>symmetric_difference(): Returns the symmetric difference of two sets as a new set<br>symmetric_difference_update(): Inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another<br>union(): Returns the union of sets in a new set<br>update(): Updates the set with the union of this set and others

1. Dictionary are using key value pairs to store values<br>2. They are made by using s1={ &quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot; } syntax<br>3. you can get all keys of dictionary by s1. keys( )<br>4. you can get all values of dictionary by using s1.values( )<br>5. you can get all pairs of dictionary by s1.items( )<br>6. you can get the value of an item by using s1[&#39;key&#39;] and it will return the value. s1.get( &quot;key&quot;) will also return the value but it wont throw an error in case there is no value/key available in the dictionary

Else condition will not be executed
So else statement works same in &#39;for loop&#39; as it works in &#39;while loop&#39;?

if we use break in for or while loop the else part of that loop will no be execute
present
10\5 bhai...🔥🔥🔥🔥
But the thing here is, ki in python indentation matters. And the else loop is out of the for loop but the if loop is inside it. So it should had run.
Yess hoga<br>😮kaise ni hua execute
First ❤class
Super❤
love you bro
Mera else loop wala question galat hua par maja aya iss lecture mae bhi
else mai jayega hi nahi
been months and i am coming back and back in order to reach 100 someday.. wish me courage
when we add the break statement, the loop will stop thereitself. the else statement will not be taken onto consideration. Thankyou

harry bhai , you are my coding guru , you saved my life
no it will not work.
for ya while loop ke saath hm log else clause the use kr skte hai, else wala part agr excute hota hai tho iska mtlb hota hai for ya while loop ne apne iterations succesfully complete kiye, agr for ya while loop ke saath hm break statement use kr le tho, else wala part excute nhi hoga kyonki else bhi for ya while loop ka part hi hota hai is case main
yes Break ho jayga and the answer will be 01234
i wil rate u 8 out of 10. harry bhai lub jo ho gaya wada from pakistan❤‍🔥
else will not be executed<br><br>Edit: I was right
nahi hoga
BRUh serious In HOOD
Ha Bhayia hoga print else condition
Execute hoga
Present sir
why it gives 0 123 not 4 when WHILE is used?
Hoga
In case of If-else, The else block will be executed only if the &quot;if condition&quot; checking Fails.<br>Likewise, The else with forloop/whileloop also, the else block will be executed, only if the &quot;forloop&quot;/&quot;whileloop&quot; condition checking fails.<br><br>If we written break in for loop or while loop then the loop will be terminated unfortunately, without the failed condition checking.<br><br>So, There after, the else block will not be executed.<br><br>I commented what i understood. If there is any mistake, please correct me...!!!
i am giving 5 star to you

Few important things to note about try and exception method:<br>1. We can use else clause with exception handling.<br>try:<br>    result = 100 / 2<br>except ZeroDivisionError:<br>    print(f&quot;Division Error&quot;)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Result is&quot;, result)<br><br>2. Using the finally clause in exception handling<br>try:<br>    result = 10 / 0<br>except ZeroDivisionError:<br>    print(&quot;Division by zero!&quot;)<br>finally:<br>    print(&quot;This block of code will always execute.&quot;)<br><br>3. Raising exceptions using raise<br>try:<br>    raise ValueError(&quot;This is a custom error message.&quot;)<br>except ValueError as e:<br>    print(&quot;An error occurred:&quot;, str(e))

Harry bhai me vs code me try kr rha hoon exception handling isme ptani kyun try and except work nhi kr rha😢
Can we use pound instead to doing all these?
plz give info about assertion error
The main thing is missing that we don&#39;t know what type of exceptions exist<br><br>I try this as a exepction handle:<br><br>def run():<br>    name=input(&quot;Enter a valid string otherwise error recieved until you enter the string :&quot;)<br>    try:<br>        hi=int(name)<br>    except ValueError as e:<br>        print(e)<br>        run()<br>run()

can someone explain print(a[num]) command
day 36
If you are trying to run a python program and there are chances of getting errors, then we can handle those errors using try-exception technique. We can use try keyword and can write your block of code inside the try with proper indentation and then, we have to use except keyword and then we can anything that we want to happen with the program exceution whenenver the error occurs. We can also specify the types of error with except keyword like index error, value error and can write the body that we want to excute upon error occuring.
Hey bro i have doubt . whats a meaning of print (a[num])
Present sir
Day 36 completed.
if the same line consists of various errors will all the lines of that particular error be in output?/ can i know the answer please
im present sir
I have typed the same program as shown in the video but on invalid input,it is showing error instead of executing the except block.What could be the reason?(indentation is correct)

I have Watched 30+ Concept of Try and except But The way of teaching of yours IS so op.
Brother can we say it&#39;s similar like if else
F kyu  lagaya
Can we use exception handling only with f-strings ?
harry bhai ek doubt tha issme appne kaha ki programmer use karte hai try...expect to find error <br>so can we use this try...except in our final code or it is used for testing purpoes?

but we can simply apply if else statements here , right ?
print(f&quot;multiplication table of (a) is :&quot;)<br>Yaha py &#39;f&#39; kyun use kiya hy?

BY CHATGPT:<br><br>There are several types of errors that can occur in Python:<br><br>Syntax errors: These occur when the code is not written in a proper format, and the interpreter is unable to understand it. For example, if you forget to close a parentheses or forget to indent code properly, you will get a syntax error.<br><br>Name errors: These occur when you try to use a variable that has not been defined.<br><br>Type errors: These occur when you try to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For example, if you try to add a string and a number, you will get a type error.<br><br>Index errors: These occur when you try to access an element in a list or a string using an index that is out of bounds.<br><br>Value errors: These occur when a built-in function receives an argument of the right type, but an inappropriate value.<br><br>Attribute errors: These occur when you try to access an attribute of an object that does not exist.<br><br>Import errors: These occur when you try to import a module that does not exist or cannot be found.<br><br>Key errors: These occur when you try to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist.<br><br>File not found errors: These occur when you try to open a file that does not exist or cannot be found.<br><br>Indentation errors: These occur when the indentation of the code is not consistent, which can cause the interpreter to behave unexpectedly.<br><br>Zero division errors: These occur when you try to divide a number by zero, which is not allowed in Python.<br><br>Recursion errors: These occur when a function calls itself recursively, but the base case is not defined, causing the function to call itself indefinitely.<br><br>Memory errors: These occur when the program tries to use more memory than the computer has available.<br><br>Overflow errors: These occur when a calculation produces a result that is too large to be stored in the allocated memory.<br><br>Underflow errors: These occur when a calculation produces a result that is too small to be represented accurately in the allocated memory.<br><br>Assertion errors: These occur when an assert statement fails.<br><br>Not implemented errors: These occur when a method or function has not been implemented yet.<br><br>Runtime errors: These occur while the program is running and can be caused by a variety of factors, such as invalid input, missing resources, or other unforeseen circumstances.<br><br>Security errors: These occur when the program tries to perform an action that is not allowed due to security restrictions.<br><br>Timeout errors: These occur when a program takes too long to run and exceeds the allotted time limit.<br><br>Unbound local errors: These occur when you try to access a local variable before it has been defined.<br><br>Internal errors: These occur when the interpreter encounters an unexpected condition that it cannot handle.<br><br>External errors: These occur when the program interacts with an external resource (such as a database or a network connection) and something goes wrong.<br><br>It is also worth noting that Python allows you to define your own custom errors using the Exception class. This can be useful if you want to create specific error handling logic for your program.

Thankyou
solid
Finally keyword is for function only o r any other use because if you write I am always executed outside the indentation of the function it will execute
best teacher on youtube
day 37
In this video lecture, we learnt about another clause of exception handling used for error handling, which is finally keyword. The block of code written inside finally clause is executed always irrespective of the retun of the values from try or except blocks in a function. This fianlly clause may be used for various purposes like closing some resourse files, closing the database connections or ending the program with some appreciative messages.
❤️❤️
hello sir, correct me if I am wrong. You may &#39;ve just deindented &quot;I am always printed&quot;  from the function, why to use finally if that can work

harry bro agar qustion 2 ka answer 3 hota toh for loop kese use krte? apne sabhi k answer option 4 rakha
bhai apke code mai run krte hoe question ky hai ye to show nahi ho rha ???
Here is a issue in this code the correct logic is -<br><br>replay = input(&quot;\nEnter 0 for exit or Choose option : &quot;)<br>    if replay == &quot;0&quot;:<br>        money = level[i-1]<br>        break<br>    if (replay.lower() == question[-1]):<br>        print(f&#39;&quot;Sahi Jawab you have won {level[i]}&quot;\n&#39;)<br>        if i == 4:<br>            money += 10000<br>        elif i ==  9:<br>            money += 320000   <br>        elif i == 14:<br>            money += 10000000   <br>    else:<br>        print(&quot;Aapka jawab galat hai!&quot;)<br>        break;<br>        <br>print(f&quot;Your take home money is {money}&quot;)
Question is not showing use this - print(f&quot;({i+1}) {question[0]}\n&quot;)<br>    print(f&quot;a. {question [1]} \t b. {question [2]}&quot;)<br>    print(f&quot;c. {question [3]} \t d. {question [4]}&quot;)

Harry bhia is may questions kaha display ho rahay hay, bus app bolay ja rahay ha or answer da ja rahay ha is question tu app ka nazar nahi a rahay hay

None kyu tha
I found a mistake in your program harry bhai.. If we dont know the first question and decide to quit, we win 1 crore rupeess.. as you have used money=levels[i-1], in the first step level becomes -1 so it gives 1crore rupees if you quit in the very first step

10/10.... I am Solution Architect with over 11 Y of Experience. Still i feel, this course is kick start of python coding and worth accepting 100 Days Challenge. 99.99% people will feel complete post attending this course. Good Work Harry!. I feel, you are carrying mission the way &quot;KHAN SIR GS PATNA &quot; is doing.. Lucky to find your course on YouTube, which made me motivated to peruse my interest toward python. &quot;EDUCATION IS FOR ALL, AN EDUCATED PERSON CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THIS...Way to go..&quot;

&#39;&#39;&#39;This python program is to code or decode a message using the following principles<br>1. words having 3 or less characters will be reversed<br>2. Words having more than 3 characters, remove the last letter, append it to the last,<br>    then insert 3 random letters to both beginning and end.<br>3. so while decoding, either the message is simply reversed or,<br>    fist and lst 3 characters are removed and then last character isremoved,<br>    and added to first, depending on the number of letters<br>4. remember that after coding, a word of 4-9 letters doesnt exist, as the 4 letter<br>    word would have been now 4+6 = 10 letter word after coding.<br>5. the prog should ask if u want to code or decode<br>&#39;&#39;&#39;<br><br>import random<br>import string<br><br><br>user_input = input(&quot;Enter the message : &quot;)<br>user_input_list = user_input.replace(&#39;,&#39;, &#39; , &#39;).replace(&#39;.&#39;, &#39; . &#39;).split()<br><br><br>def reverse(x):<br>    &#39;&#39;&#39;This is to reverse the word when called&#39;&#39;&#39;<br><br>    return x[::-1]<br><br><br>def random_letters():<br>    &#39;&#39;&#39;This is to generate three letters at random&#39;&#39;&#39;<br>    letter = &quot;&quot;<br>    for _ in range(3):<br>        letter += random.choice(string.ascii_letters)<br>    return letter<br><br><br>def code(text):<br>    &#39;&#39;&#39;This is to code the given message&#39;&#39;&#39;<br>    output = []<br>    for i in text:<br>        if len(i) &lt;= 3:<br>            output.append(reverse(i))<br>        else:<br>            first = i[0]<br>            word = random_letters() + i[1:] + first + random_letters()<br>            output.append(word)<br><br>    coded = &#39;&#39;<br>    for word in output:<br>        coded += &#39; &#39; + word<br><br>    return coded<br><br><br>def decode(text):<br>    &#39;&#39;&#39;This is to decode the messsage&#39;&#39;&#39;<br>    output = []<br>    for i in text:<br>        if len(i) &lt;= 3:<br>            output.append(reverse(i))<br>        else:<br>            main_word = i[3:-3]<br>            first = main_word[-1]<br>            word = first + main_word[:-1]<br>            output.append(word)<br><br>    decoded = &#39;&#39;<br>    for word in output:<br>        decoded += &#39; &#39; + word<br><br>    return decoded<br><br><br>command = input(<br>    &quot;What do you want to do, code or decode?

Harry, this was super informative. Thanks for keeping things simple!
Guys... if you are getting errors (like activation not enabled, scripting is disabled) in windows... do this.. <br><br>** Delete the myevn file first**  or you can totally jump into the existing directory through command prompt<br><br>1. close the powershell<br>2. go and open command prompt<br>3. go to the directory using cd command. .. (for example if I want to create a the environment in python-enviro in D directory, type D: enter and then cd python-enviro &lt;enter&gt;<br><br>4. run the command python -m venv myevn &lt;enter&gt;(you can give any name in the place of myenv, basically a folder will be created with this name)<br>5. type cd myevn &lt;enter&gt;(or the name you have given)<br>6. type cd Scripts &lt;enter&gt;<br><br>7. type activate &lt;enter&gt; (or deactivate to deactivate)<br><br>   succesfully activated :)

How to write code in pycharm on an activated virtual environment in windows?
Felt like this was the most informative video in the whole series. Learnt so many news things about python. Thanks Harry bhai♥
this repel not working
I am here.
for windows user simply follow the following commands- <br># for making a new environment (same)-&gt;  python -m venv dir_name<br># for activation  of that environment-  dir_name\Scripts\activate<br><br>I also got stuck in this so decided to help !
If you are using window, you can use below commands :)<br><br>1. virtualenv dir_name  ( in dir_name you can write anything )<br>2. dir_name/Scripts/activate  ( for activating )<br>3. deactivate ( for deactivating )
Tip : you can also make multiple folders using this python -m venv There are many Folders HUh<br>Now it will make There folder , are folder, many folder , Foldres folder and HUh folder
virtual evironment is not activating

Understanding this topic was a bit difficult, also please avoid to use the same name for the examples as that of the predefined values, as you have used &quot;main &#39; in this topic

sir mere sheel me open ho  he nhi raha hain shell b kr liya and CMD b
just a confusion: I think , what I learned was we  need to put, if <i>_name__==&quot;__main__&quot; , in the module or script we want to import in our main file , but, if that module is too long, their might be problem for us to check and put, if__name_</i>   in that script, is there code that we can put on our main function rather than some other peoples long script. i think, it will be easy for us if we can put some code in our main file above the function we can to run, rather than checking and putting if <i>_name_</i> code in others script ???? I I dont know , if i am getting confused or more curious about python...

Best information till now 🔥🙏🔥
DOUBT:  if we don&#39;t want any function to run from the imported file then can&#39;t we just not call the function at the end of that particular file

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lSQfOJKn7U&amp;t=11m27s"">11:27</a> - Purely random karne ke 2 ways hai. import random statement to dono me hi aayegi.<br><br>1. Import string. Is module ke andar ek ascii_letters naam ka object hota hai, which is a string of all the alphabets in lowercase and uppercase. We have 26 alphabets in total. Lowercase and Uppercase mila ke 26*2=52 hote hai. To 0-51 me se koi bhi 3 numbers generate karke slicing karke us index ka character utha lenge.<br><br>Example,<br>import random, string<br>x=&quot;String&quot;<br>for i in range(3):<br>    x = string.ascii_letters[random.randint(0, 51)] + x<br>for i in range(3):<br>    x = x + string.ascii_letters[random.randint(0, 51)]<br><br><br>2. Using chr() function : chr() function given number ke corresponding ASCII value return kar deta hai. To ham 0-25 ek random number generate karwa lenge, then usme 65 add kar lenge. Then resulting number ko chr() ke andar pass kar denge. Same cheez ko 3 baar start ke liye and 3 baar end ke liye kar lenge,<br><br><br>Example,<br>import random<br>x = &quot;String&quot;<br>for i in range(3):<br>    x = chr(65+random.randint(0,25)) + x<br>for i in range(3):<br>    x = x + chr(65+random.randint(0,25))<br><br><br>3. 2nd wale me uppercase and lowercase ko alag alag bhi kar sakte hai.<br><br>Example, <br>import random<br>x = &quot;String&quot;<br>for i in range(3):<br>    up = random.randint(0,1)<br>    if up==1:<br>        x = chr(65+random.randint(0,25)) + x<br>    else:<br>        x = chr(97+random.randint(0,25)) + x<br>for i in range(3):<br>    up = random.randint(0,1)<br>    if up==1:<br>        x = x + chr(65+random.randint(0,25))<br>    else:<br>        x = x + chr(97+random.randint(0,25))

harry brother is like god of programming he knows all of it I can see a lot of tutorial on this channel with different tech stack all of them are highly recommended for beginner as I also started learning development from this channel in my college time learnt a lot from here got placed now think of switching to next tech stack again came back here and I know from this in a very fun way only over here we need more harry. (and other thing is he is uploading this much costly things at free of cost).  st end i want to say no one can teach me better than harry because most of the tutorials are always on serious note. and also i am a huge admirer&#39;s of your&#39;s may be we met in person in near future someday.

A new statement will be written.While when using append mode i can write at the end of my file.But in my case wether I used append mode or Write mode i am getting the same result.Statements are being added at the end

&quot;errno 9 bad file descriptor &quot; , while running .What should I do anyone
for doing this in vs code you have to write the directory name too before the file name if they both are in the same directory

Ek baat mujhe confirm kara do koii Ki jaise file exist nahi karto aur open karne par ban jati hai waise hi kya farari ka darwaja kholne se sach me farari a jayegi kya 😂
Bro I think you are missing to teach about files and file structure.<br>I had a lot of issue running in my VScode. Cause<br>My terminal was not at the same directory at as the file. I didn&#39;t understood it first and hence lost 10 dyas.<br>Guys if you are unable to do it just try learning cmd commands and trying to find it where you default path is.

Sir seek() mein aur bhi concepts hai shayad<br><br>1. seek(offset, whence); where whence=0,1,2 which helps to move the file pointer with reference to either beginning, current position or end of file<br><br>2. offset value can be both +ve and -ve; the first to move forward and the latter to move backward

Honestly, the video and the fundamentals of you are the best, but it will only prove beneficial if you could help us with some 30-40 exercises to do. In order to gain the practical concepts of python. Because we have to refer to multiple sites to solve the questions and they use mixed concepts. So I would ask you to give us exercises based on the topic you are teaching.
Amazing Tutorial ....<br>This video is so helpful .. Thank you broo

This day is technical theoretic to understand !
The best part of the video is,  I am not playing with you
I&#39;m present.
for tuple a is b - false in colab and in replit it is true why?
map muje samaj nehi aia
💕
day 54
Sir I am present
A = (1,2)<br>B = (1,2)<br>print(A is B)<br>O/p :<br>False <br>This is not working in Google Colab and in  VS Code but in Replit it is giving (True) for these statements. Reason ?????
If we evaluate the below code<br>a = (1,2)<br>b = (1,2)<br>print(a is b)<br><br>The answer is True in some IDE&#39;s like PyCham.<br>The answer is False in CMD, Mac Terminal or Jupyter.<br>same id for complex number and float numbers. This is because Python my default allocate two same tuples, complex numbers and float numbers to different memory location but IDE&#39;s like like PyCharm, they might have specific optimisations or configurations which allocate in same memory location.<br><br>@CodeWithHarry
He is not good.Harray bhai is best
Check memory location of any variable by using print(id(variablename)) by which you can properly understand( is vs &#39; ==&#39; )
# &#39;is&#39; vs &#39;==&#39; in Python<br><br>&quot;&quot;&quot; <br>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>b = [1, 2, 3]<br><br>print(a == b)<br>print(a is b)<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot;&quot; <br>Output:<br>True<br>False<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br><br><br># another example<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>a = &#39;Hello&#39;<br>b = &#39;Hello&#39;<br><br>print(a == b)<br>print(a is b)<br><br>a = 5<br>b = 5<br><br>print(a == b)<br>print(a is b)<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot;&quot; <br>Output:<br>True<br>True<br>True<br>True<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;

Harry bhai I have made this program a long time ago but It was with Rock ,Papper ,Scissors. Do I still need to make this one?
Sir aapne kaha ki computer jo choose karega vo random hoga uspe hamara control nhi hoga lekin ye ham kaise banaenge <br>Shayad random module se <br>Lekin abhi tak aapne random module nhi bataya

What an explanation Bhai⭐ loved it
I&#39;m present.
Easy for c++ students ❤️
Awesome and very easy to understand
Inheritance means upgrade kar dena kisi chij ko
Another video😅
Harry sir class always be write and  capital maybe I will got your answer
Harry sir<br>I have one question <br>why you writing Railway in first letter &quot;R&quot;  is capital
everything a side but &quot;urhne wala phone&quot; ka example hits different level
I referred Udemy course. It was too fast and I could not understand because the instructor assumes that we know the basics. In fact the course was for the beginners. But your explanation are far simplified. Thanks to you! Bro
Inheritance is method to accessing properties of one class to another class not extending features in class😂
day 56
Thanks so much sir after watch your vedio sir I realise it is next level course to master python course <br>Thanks you so much sir <br>I recommend for every student to explore this series for python<br> language because of I believe that you can not get better course for python <br>FREE OF COST <br>THANKS HARRY SIR
Sir I am present
herry bhi itna moshkil example kyo de rahai hen as ko ap simple bhi kar sakte thy <br>class employee():<br>    def __init__(self, name,age,gender):<br>        self.name=name<br>        self.age=age<br>        self.gender=gender<br>    def show_Employee(self):<br>        print(&quot;\n me of Employee&quot;,self.name)<br>        print(&quot;Age of Employee&quot;,self.age)<br>        print(&quot;gender&quot;,self.gender)<br>aijaz = employee(&quot;aijaz&quot;, 32, &quot;Male&quot;)<br>aijaz.show_Employee()

I really enjoyed your video on object-oriented programming in Python. I had a basic understanding of classes and objects before watching the video, but your explanation helped me to solidify my understanding.
perfect example of a drone🤣, by the way, bht acha smjhaya
This lesson wasn&#39;t like I expected. I think your explanation about OOP is not so detailed

Nice work bro. Greater teaching 💥
I really enjoyed your video on object-oriented programming in Python. I had a basic understanding of classes and objects before watching the video, but your explanation helped me to solidify my understanding.<br><br>For example, the class Dog might define the properties name and breed, and the methods run(), eat(), and sleep(). An object of the Dog class would have a specific name and breed, and it would be able to run, eat, and sleep.<br><br>Thank you so much for such an amazing course! I&#39;m really enjoying learning Python.

self ka matlab wo object jisper ye method call ho raha hai...
Self:    Object that we use for himself.
self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables that belongs to the class
I leave this on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7baAGCBA9U&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a>
self means oy a variable ta jar jonno func ta call kora hocee
Bhai basics par itna advanced kyun sikha rahe ho?
self parameter is used to call the object in particular method
Self is a reference to the current instance of the class and is use to access variable that belong to the particular class.
Self ka mtlb vo object jise cal kiya jaa rha hai
self object matlab vo object jiske liye ye method call kiya jaa raha hai
Self ka mtlb vo object jiske liye ye method call kiya jaa rha h
self parameter is a reference to current instance of the class
Self  ka matlab jis ka lia method call ho raha hi
Vo object jisse ye call ho raha hai
self ka mtlb wo instance or object that is being called with the function
meaning of self:- wo object jiske liye method call kiye ja raha hai
self is those object in which method is call
self parameter means that object for which these methods are being called.
self means that object for that  the method is calling
Self is objective for which method is called 😊
self means the object for which the method is being called
self k matlab wo object jisko call kiya jaa rha hai
Self means the object for which the method is called
self ka matlab wo object jispe method use ho raha hai
Self woh hai jiske liye instance create Kara ja raha hai
Very good video
self ka mtlb bo object jisper ya method call ho raha hai
self means wo object jispe method call ho raha hai
Self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class ,and is used to access variables that belongs to the class
Self ka mtlb wo object jiske upar ye method call ho rha hai
I&#39;m present.
Self: vo OBJECT jiskeliye method call kiya ja raha hei.
Self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class ,and is used to access variables that belongs to the class
SELF KA MATLAB YE METHOD JIS OBJECT PE CALL HO RAHA HAI
self matlab referring to the object for which that class method is being called. Thanks Harry Bhai, I tried lots of documents and videos to understand this self, but you have explained it in a best possible way.
self ka matlab vo object jispe ye method call hoo raha h
Self is the object being called
self means the object for which  this method is called
Me watching this video 4 hours before my exam 😂😂
self ka matlab vo object jispar method apply ho raha h
Self ka mtlb woh object jis pr yah method call ho rha hai
aap ek hi din mei kaphi video banate ho bhaiya lekin , upload every day
Self ka matlab vo object jiske liye ye method call Kiya ja rha h.
Self ka matlab vo object  jiske liye function call kara jaa raha h

today i learnt constructors yah!
Harry vai ak doubt tha:<br>ap phale a ko then b ko pass kar rahe to . to mera question ya ha ki jo yea constructor ke under jo print statement ha ya chis ak ak bad ak ku print ho raha he. Yese to phale akber print ho ne ke bad a se jo arguments pass kar rahe ho app use print karbha na he then wo phir se printf statement ko print kare ga ata the time of b . Par ya to ak ke bad ak ho raha he . Ya kyu ho raha he?

I would like  to add one thing.<br>The Classes which use constructors are called abstract classes. This is important because if we want to use a constructor in other languages, we have to mention the abstract class.

Dec 2020 - Pakistan’s economic situation will worsens, and the dollar reserves will begin to decline <br>sharply. Despite government efforts, $ reserves do not improve and the reserve balance ends up <br>being negative. Many of Muhammad Qasim’s dreams about Pakistan &amp; Imran Khan have already come true..

Sir I am present
why use fx and mfx ?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTBZ674EsvI&amp;t=10m28s"">10:28</a> preach !
what is log function ??
sir ji namaste , hm isse pehle *aargs or **kwargs nh padhe hai .
Thanks sir, 5 min me concept clear kr diya aapne!
as far as i remember , you have not shared *args and **karg in previous videos
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23doubt"">#Doubt</a> Why did we make an mfx function inside greet function. Is it required to make two functions in a decorator everytime
# Define a decorator function<br>def my_decorator(func):<br>    def wrapper():<br>        print(&quot;Something is happening before the function is called.&quot;)<br>        func()<br>        print(&quot;Something is happening after the function is called.&quot;)<br><br>    return wrapper<br><br><br># Use the decorator with the &quot;@&quot; symbol<br>@my_decorator<br>def say_hello():<br>    print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)<br><br><br># Call the decorated function<br>say_hello()
Idk why something’s are difficult to understand 😢
if we have more than 2 args, guide a different example to understand. explain this function with more arguments or if using tuple????????
What if we have 3 args to pass to a function ??
Bhai *args and **kwargs kb padhaii tumne
its start getting complex

This is the implementation of decorator pattern of Gang of Four, in which we add additional responsibility, if we use @ method then it apply on every call but second method only call on those on which we applied
you thought of anything , harry bhai is already with playlist waiting for u to come and learn from him........💙

the logging code doesnt work in replit<br><br>edit : it needs interactive window to run  or use  print in the code
best explanation harry ,thanks
Why do we need to wrap greet function with mfx() ?
ROFL &quot;Nahi ho aise theek&quot; :D ...Haha very well explained and superb MOM like comments :)
(*args) and (*kwargs )did not explained by you :-   HARRY BHAI😻😻😻😻😻😻😻

Harry bhai you are truly right when I started learn c in 2017 there were only a handful of channels with classroom type teaching videos, I joined a local coaching just to learn that language, still makes me think how quickly things have changed, all thanks to creators like you, and the god who created this tech called internet

<b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTBZ674EsvI&amp;t=10m30s"">10:30</a></b><b> , man this shit is deep🔥</b>

you always helped me alot😊😊
I have one question after the setter method is defined, print(obj.ten_value) should print 670 right?
poklaaaaaa 💩💩💩💩💩💩
grate👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
This chapter was too much hard i watched it 4 time and also done in replit 6 times
Harry bhai, getter is behaving like normal methods then what is the use of it ?? Without using @property annotation in your program(i.e getter ) it will perform its action .
Day by day aap kya padhe rahe ho smjh nahi aa rha... Previous video mai args* kb padhaai apne bol deya padha deye..<br><br>Or ye video dono video mai pta nahi kya pdha rahe ho
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5
My experience for Getters and Setters is 2/10. You made the topic a bit tough. you explained like this is a revision class for getter and setter.  I am very my delighted with this 100 days coding challenge. I give it a solid  9/10 for the python playlist. But in this topic you were a bit inconsistent.
poor explaination in this video
first video which have not understand at all
This is the first lesson that i didn&#39;t really understand. 😵
Decorators , Getters and Setters not explained very well. Leaving these topics, I got very confused.
<b>Not Clear</b><br>Getters and Setters Not Explain Well<br>Before 60days everything was Nicely Explain ❤️
Sabse bakvas explanation of 100 days of code
you made it lil bit tough to understand getter setter
im present sir
Am i the only one who thinks he teaches like we already know everything? because he already knows everything, so its easy for him but not for neutral audience who is just beginning with python.
cool guy
watched 1 times didnt understand and watched 2nd time little bit understand now going for other source video
I think you dont have mood to teach in this videos coz I dont understand a single thing in this video
Could you tell me what this underscore &quot;_&quot; means?
🎀🎀
class MyClass:<br>    def __init__(self, value):<br>        self._value = value<br>In self._value why we use underscore (_) at the beginning of value???
oops topics are a bit complex to understand
do we always have to create getter first in order to create setter??
why did we use @decorators here is there any specific reason to use it or its fine if we dont ?

harry bhai yeh kya chal rha hai kuch samajh nhi aa rha pichle episode se, bhagao mt pls
Tq sir✌️
just amazing broooo thankyou for   this kind of content
A setter updates the value of a variable, while a getter reads the value of a variable.
So i have question i tried to make setter to change values but it didn&#39;t worked as i expected it to be So, what i did is this let me know if its correct or there is way to change two values with only 1 setter.<br><br>class sum():<br>  def __init__(self, num1, num2):<br>    self.num1 = num1<br>    self.num2  = num2<br><br>  def show(self):<br>    print(f&quot;The num you just puted are {self.num1} and {self.num2}&quot;)<br>    print(f&quot;sum: {self.num1 + self.num2}&quot;)<br>  <br>  @property<br>  def sum_new_number1(self):<br><br>    return self.num1<br><br>  @sum_new_number1.setter<br>  def new_number1(self, new_num1):<br>    self.num1 = new_num1<br><br>  @property<br>  def sum_new_number2(self):<br><br>    return self.num2<br><br>  @sum_new_number2.setter<br>  def new_number2(self, new_number2):<br>    self.num2 = new_number2<br>    <br><br><br>var = sum(10, 10)<br><br>var.show()<br><br>var.new_number1 = 11<br>var.new_number2 = 11<br><br>var.show()<br><br>print(var.sum_new_number1)<br>print(var.sum_new_number2)
Getters aur Setters kia hota hai koi mujhe easy me smjha do please 🙏
Hi Sir , I am from Pakistan and I am new here.<br>Your teaching method is amazing.<br>Sir, kindly guide me about that how can I access your notes that you write. <br>Thank you for uploading such an amazing tutorial.
I am not clear, anyone can help me to clear this video
what is the difference between self.value and self._value
I watched your 60 videos from my both accounts, it was revision of all your 60 videos out of 100, really informative, my logic got cleared and i started creating little test cases and unit tests based of python netmiko and paramiko as well. if you have videos about the api and web control using python and selenium, pls share link of that.
Bull shit explanation....
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gbCT8h9uyk&amp;t=2m05s"">2:05</a> ye _value variable konsa he ??<br>Hmne declare to nhi kiya he ye

bhai recursion aasan tha samajhana magar ye its confusing
This topic was so easy but you made it little bit tough. <br>If you don&#39;t use 10 it would be much easier.
If someone is having problems understanding setters and getters you can watch this old video <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3R_P5j41ns&amp;ab_channel=CodeWithHarry"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3R_P5j41ns&amp;ab_channel=CodeWithHarry</a><br><br>which is from codewiththarry python playlist 2018.
a side cod e from my side --<br>class employee:<br>    def __init__(self, salary) -&gt; None:<br>        self.salary = salary<br>        self.bonussalary = 700<br>    def show(self):<br>        print(f&quot;salary is {self.salary}&quot;)<br>        print(f&quot;bonussalary is {self.bonussalary}&quot;)<br>    @property<br>    def totalsalary(self):<br>        return self.salary + self.bonussalary<br>    @totalsalary.setter<br>    def totalsalary(self, newtotalsalary):<br>        self.salary = newtotalsalary - self.bonussalary<br>if <i>_name_</i> == &#39;__main__&#39;:<br>    employee = employee(11000)<br>    employee.totalsalary = 10000<br>    print(employee.totalsalary)<br>    employee.show()<br><br>      that also teach getter and setter function

Very helpful, Thank you 🙏
Sir I am Present
this is day4 and im watching 11 hr series continuously but god promise i never skipped your intro its just amazing how u made that can u pls share
Harry Bhai, if u watch comments, Pls clear a doubt:<br>If we just change the name of class, all places where the class was previously mentioned will raise an error. But even if we use inheritance to create a new class containing the prev class, it still raises an error if we use any functions of the new class using prev class name. So, in the eg in this vid, we have to again change wherever employee was mentioned to programmer to access new programmer methods.<br>But we could just change the name of employee to programmer in the class def, as well as when we call the class methods and that would be alright<br>Please clarify how we benefit from inheritance, if we already have a class created and want to add new functions in it, but can&#39;t do that by just adding those methods in the class again, instead of using inheritance
im present sir
Harry bhai last me pita ka bahut achha udhaharan diya😂

Harry i used a different function at the place of random module. I created a set of 3 values 0 1 and2 and used pop function instead and its working great.
import random<br>l = [&quot;snake&quot;,&quot;water&quot;,&quot;gun&quot;]<br>user_input = input()<br>coumputer = random.choice(l)<br>while True:<br>  userstore = 0<br>  coumputerstore = 0<br>  if (user_input==&quot;snake&quot; and coumputer==&quot;water&quot;):<br>    print (&quot;user won&quot;, userstore + 1)<br>  elif (user_input==&quot;water&quot; and coumputer==&quot;snake&quot;):<br>    print (&quot;coumputer won&quot;, coumputerstore + 1)<br>  elif (user_input==&quot;gun&quot; and coumputer==&quot;snake&quot;):<br>    print (&quot;user won&quot;, userstore + 1)<br>  elif (user_input==&quot;snake&quot; and coumputer==&quot;gun&quot;):<br>    print (&quot;coumputer won&quot;, coumputerstore + 1)<br>  user_input + 1

No the books cannot be store in a memory after the program is stopped as every time the instance or an object completed its work, a destructor will automatically called and it will destroy the memory hold by the objects. Also, at creation of every new book a new constructor is called which allocates memory for that instance which holds the properties of a class.

Harry Sir, thanks a lot for this course, I haven&#39;t studied Python in my academics, but because of your courses I feel that I do have an edge over others.
class Library:<br>    Books={}<br>    User=eval(input(&quot;Enter Items in Key:Values pairs: &quot;))<br>    <br>        <br>    Updater=Books.update(User)<br>    <br>    A=Books.keys()<br>    B=Books.values()<br><br><br>Roshan=Library<br>print(Roshan.Books)<br>print(&quot;Your input Keys:&quot;)<br>print(Roshan.A)<br>print(&quot;Your input Values:&quot;)<br>print(Roshan.B)
accepted the challenge.

Hello Sie<br><br>Sorry to interrupt but I think<br>ek scenario hai jaha no. of employees<br>instance variable hoga<br><br><br>It&#39;s when a person holds multiple business <br>and he wants to keep track of each of them<br><br>please cprrect me if I am wrong at any piont
I enjoy the starting theme song
Then,does it mean that compiler searches for instance variables and then for class variables in case instance variables are absent?? <br>Please anyone clarify 🤔
No doubt, aap ka sab videos mai maja ata hai

Both variables are changing values values for instance then what is the difference between two
This topic is so confusing....there is only one difference between them and that is position. Bcoz when we changed the instance to 0.3 the entire thing did not change it changed only for harry same with class so what is the difference?
exercise 6 solution<br>class libraray:<br>    books={}<br>    def __init__(self,noofbooks,books):<br>        self.noofbooks=i<br>        self.books=t<br>    i=0<br>    t=0<br>for i in range(0,11):<br>    print(i+1)<br>for t in range(0,11):<br>    print(t+1)<br>i = int(input(&quot;Enter a value for i: &quot;))<br>t = int(input(&quot;Enter a value for t: &quot;))<br>if i == t:<br>    print(&quot;The number of books is equal to the books in the library.&quot;)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Invalid text&quot;)

Instance ka meaning kya hota hai?
Present ✋🏻Sir
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I don&#39;t understand why in init we write self and give another value with use of self and also when we make another function we also use self and give another name association with self i.e. self .variable like this somebody tell me why??

harry bhai persist vali last line ka answer nai dia aapne
Hey.... here&#39;s my solution....i think you&#39;ll find damn easy.....<br><br>Class library<br>def __init__(self):<br>   self.noofbooks = 0<br>   self.books = [] <br><br> def addbook(self,book):<br>      self.books.append<br>(book)<br>   self.noofbooks += 1<br> <br>def all_books(self):<br>  if (self.noofbooks == len(self.books))<br>print(f&quot;The library has{self.books} in a library)<br>else:<br>Print(&quot;opps you got an error)<br>  def show_allbooks(self):<br>     print(f&quot;Total no.

harry sir, you didn&#39;t upload the notes on replit for  69#
hey Harry, in note it is mentioned that -It&#39;s important to note that class methods cannot modify the class in any way. If you need to modify the class, you should use a class level variable instead.<br>But, when you used changeCompany=&quot;Tesla&quot; it did change class variable to &quot;Tesla&quot;, isnt it contradicting

For example, in above case without call mehtod we only knew about the name of employee and the company he is working in. But after using call method we further know that he is also working as the ceo of finance committee.
But sir, we can print the len of name like :<br># Coding :<br>class Employee:<br>    name = &quot;harry&quot;<br>    # def __len__(self):<br>    #     i = 0<br>    #     for c in <a href=""http://self.name/"">self.name:</a><br>    #         i += 1<br>    #     return i<br><br>e = Employee()<br>print(e.name)<br># print(len(e))<br><br>print(len(e.name))

ye samjh nhi aaya agar lenth hi nikalni thi to len() ya count() lete phir call kar lete __len__() ka kya faida?
Sir I am Present
print(len(e.name)) isse v length nikal sakta h

I think the practical use case of  def__call__(self ) : is to add a definition or conclusion of a class which can easily be obtained

i think call method can be used by the programmer to tell about the class in simple words
today I think I will finally complete this course<br>I will grind the whole 27  remaining videos in one day
bro we can actually use the printing of length of name by print(len(e.name))
BRO, At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgQVJXhuLQ&amp;t=3m26s"">3:26</a> you can also write ----- print(len(e.name))
that is asnwer of queck qustion
Very good and informative content.... This is the most user friendly and learner friendly tutorial channel. Harry bhai 9999 kilo shukriya...
Bhai please come straight to the point u waste so much time you came to the point in the last 10 minutes of the video u just waste so much time I cant tell enough.
bro <br>print(len(e.name) is working

Din ke din boring hoota jaa raha hain, acchi tarha se explain bhi nehi kiya ja raha hain topics ko.<br>Kiya bhi bolu, sasta course hain jada expectations bhi nehi rakkha ja sakta.
kuki error nhi de esliye
if i don&#39;t keep your photo in my room then  i am not worthfulll to watch your priceless vdos 4 free.Thanks
Harry bhaiya, if we use print(len(e.name)) then it works fine though

I think the practicle use case of  def__call__(self ) : method will be to add conclusion to a class or it can used to find total amount at the end of class

Call method can be used to use a class instance like a function. We can give arguments and executes it however we want

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yfYC36JY&amp;t=4m14s"">4:14</a> bhai kyun kar rahe ho dimag hang hogaya
Hi harry!<br>I tried method overriding the same way as in the video,but when i used super().parent_class_method() in calculations in a method in inherited child class,I was getting error saying super().parent_class_method() is of Nonetype whereas ur code got executed<br>somone pls help
am getting error of multiplying string with number when am using super().area()
It&#39;s important to note that when you override a method, the new implementation must have the same method signature as the original method. This means that the number and type of arguments, as well as the return type, must be the same.<br><br>@CodeWithHarry Please check the last statement<br><br>The number of arguments can be different.
Great

Asalamu A<br>likum Sir! 👋<br><br><br>I&#39;ve put in a lot of effort to complete the exercise, but I&#39;m facing an issue. 😕 I find it difficult to understand the module, and it&#39;s also confusing to comprehend how many methods are present in this module and when to use each function. 🤔 The detailed functions available in VS Code or the documentation are hard to grasp due to their syntax and terminology. 😓 I&#39;m unable to determine which parameter serves what purpose and when it should be used. It would be great if you could provide some guidance. 🙏 Currently, I&#39;m also seeking help from ChatGPT, but it&#39;s not always possible to easily understand what a function or method is intended for just through code suggestions.<br><br>For example:<br><br>PdfWriter Class: 📝<br>This class is used to write PDF files, typically with pages produced by another class, such as PdfReader.<br><br>append Method: ➕<br>This method is similar to the merge() method but is used to concatenate all pages at the end of the file.<br><br>fileobj: 📄 This can be a File Object or an object with read and seek methods, similar to a File Object. It could also be a string representing a path to a PDF file.<br><br>outline_item: 📑 Optionally, you can provide a string to create an outline (bookmark) that identifies the start of the included file.<br><br>pages: 📃 This can be a PageRange, a tuple (start, stop[, step]), or a list of pages. It&#39;s used to merge a specific range of pages from the source document into the output document.<br><br>import_outline: ↪ If set to False, you can prevent importing the source document&#39;s outline (bookmarks).<br><br>excluded_fields: 🚫 You can provide a list of fields/keys to be ignored. If &quot;/Annots&quot; is in the list, annotations will be ignored. If &quot;/B&quot; is in the list, articles will be ignored.
you have not told us hoe to make pdf or any other topic of this exercise, even you copy pasted it in solution video

Harry vaiya. I have been using cracked/ pirated windows and many more software like photoshop etc. Recently I came to know about all the malware &amp; viruses they may contain so I want to use all genuine software. If I remove previous windows key and add purchased windows key will it become malwareless? Because I do not want to lose any data by reinstalling windows. Also If I uninstall cracked applications will it also remove malware that came with it? Love from Bangladesh.

I just wanted to say thank you for your Python tutorials. I&#39;ve been learning Python for a few months now, and your videos have been incredibly helpful. I love the way you explain things in a clear and concise way, and I always feel like I&#39;m learning something new.<br><br>I&#39;m really enjoying learning Python, and I&#39;m excited to see what I can create with it. Thanks again for your great videos!
What if we have to print from all the classes?
The video could have been provided with little more depth. Specially by showing how to call a constructor of the multiple classes apart from using the super() method
hi if we can make multiple use of on variable name then  like we are using show on two places but its calling only one time

Bhaiya jo ap krte ho
Sir i am present
the reason there r three lines can instead of 4 can be elaborated, but i will stay short: the class Dog needed only 2 arguments and would print only 3 lines as a result.
When you called dog()...it will not come down for execution because it is never inherited
AOA, Sir<br>In mro() when you run method resolution order  you get the list of class. Which is the last class aka object in this list as we don&#39;t defined it in the code<br><br><br>t&lt;ctass &#39; _main .GoldenRetriever &lt;class<br>main .Animal&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;object<br>ass
The critical point to understand is that when a subclass (e.g., Dog) overrides a method from its superclass (e.g., Animal), calling the method on an instance of the subclass will invoke the overridden version in the subclass, not the one from the superclass. However, if you want to access the superclass&#39;s method from the subclass, you can explicitly call it using the superclass name, as shown in Animal.show_details(self) and Dog.show_details(self) calls.

POV: A human learns python...
I&#39;m present 💝
When we are calling show_details function of class Dog , because this function again calls show_details of class Animal , so it print name ,species and breed .<br><br>When we are calling show _ details of class Animal it directly prints the details because there is no calling of any parent class method .
now i can play with python

Hello sir I am diploma 3rd year student and I want a simple project of python please help me .
When we call GoldenRetriever object it takes argument (name, color) and calls the two classes Dog and Animal also that prints Breed and (name, species) respectively and Color is printed by the GoldenRetriever class.<br>So the output wiill be:<br><br>Name: <br>Species:<br>Breed:<br>Color:<br><br>But when we call the Dog objec takes (name, breed) as argument and further calls the animal class which prints name and species and the breed is printed by the dog class itself. So here Color is not printed because it is printed by GoldenRetriever class and the class is not called here.<br><br>Name:<br>Species:<br>Breed:
Harry bro ap shadi kab kar re ho?
When calling show_detail() on Dog class, it will show name, species and breed. The breed is from method overriding of show_details() from Animal class in Dog class, so it will show breed from the Dog class and name and species from the animal class.<br><br>When calling show_details() on Animal class, it will only show the name and species of the animal as only these two are defined in the show_details() method.
Bro how can we make attribute and value and link with product eg- I have many type of product and so if I create attribute then value will multiple and all will link with product can we do this in django

You should learn PyPDF2 first because the PdfWriter Class does not have the ability to merge files. Use the PdfMerger Class instead. @CodeWithHarry

Now I am start understanding how to combine the different module to make meaning full thing:<br><br>Here is the code of congratulation to every one who complete the task:<br><br>from gtts import gTTS<br>import playsound<br>import os<br>List_names = [&#39;Abdullah&#39;, &quot;Hanzala&quot;,&#39;Aun&#39;, &#39;Umair&#39;, &#39;Ubaid&#39;, &#39;Ali&#39;]<br><br>for name in List_names:<br>    speak = gTTS(f&#39;Congratulation {name}&#39;)<br>    name_speak_file_location= speak.save(f&#39;{name}.mp3&#39;)<br>    name_speak_file_location= os.fspath(f&#39;{name}.mp3&#39;)<br>    playsound.playsound(name_speak_file_location)<br>    os.remove(name_speak_file_location)<br><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Now  I am thinking to make HTTP request and get all the people name using module ( I guess HTML parser or HTML Selector ) who complete the reple and play sound on every person
Sorry I actually don&#39;t use raplit, I use vscode

why no one is taking 5 minutes and talking about climate change?<br>non-veg consumption comes under top 5 causes of climate change as per UN report. UN suggests we must reduce our non-veg consumption to counter climate change. reducing non-veg consumption by 20% will have huge impact, and future generation will not suffer, they will not despise us. Almost 98% of world&#39;s population is non-vegetarian. <br>All social media influencers must spread awareness in thia regard among masses. <br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23may_god_save_climate"">#may_god_save_climate</a>

Guys if u have trouble understanding the topic try understanding it from the previous python series it&#39;s better explained there.

Walrus is such a nice addition to python, when I first started using python I always felt the lack of assignment inside expression a major issue.
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCmMEEyzLT8&amp;t=3m32s"">3:32</a> To anyone wondering, his explanation is wrong, &#39;n&#39; does not takes the value of numbers, or strings, Rather &#39;n&#39; is a bool type and stays True untill the loop ends and comes out. After that if you type print(n), You will see False as a result.

Dear Harry Sir,<br><br>I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere admiration and gratitude for all that you have accomplished in the programming world. Your expertise and innovation have truly set you apart as an extraordinary person. As someone who looks up to you and aspires to follow in your footsteps, I have a small request to make. I was wondering if you could create a full-stack course that would allow us to learn everything altogether. I understand that this is a daunting task, but I believe that with your knowledge and expertise, you could make it happen. Please know that your contributions to the programming world are highly valued and deeply appreciated. You have already shared so much knowledge with us, and for that, we are endlessly grateful. I hope you will consider my request, and I look forward to the possibility of learning from you in this new way.<br>Ramesh Kumar

Subject: Need Help with VS Code and File Management<br><br>Dear Harry,<br><br>I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and express my appreciation for your fantastic &quot;100 Days of Code in Python&quot; series on Replit. It has been an invaluable resource for someone like me who is eager to learn and improve their Python programming skills. Your teaching style is clear and engaging, and I have learned a lot from your tutorials.<br><br>While I have been able to follow along and understand most of the concepts you&#39;ve covered, I have encountered a particular issue when attempting to replicate some of your examples in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Specifically, I am having trouble with the file management aspects, especially when you use the &quot;shutil&quot; module to create and manipulate multiple files.<br><br>In Replit, it seems quite straightforward, but when I attempt to do the same in VS Code, I encounter challenges that I&#39;m struggling to overcome. I believe there might be some differences in how file operations work or how the file structure is managed in VS Code compared to Replit.<br><br>I was wondering if you could provide some guidance or advice on how to handle file operations, particularly with the &quot;shutil&quot; module, within the VS Code environment. Any tips, best practices, or resources you could recommend would be greatly appreciated. I want to ensure that I can effectively apply the concepts you&#39;ve taught in my own projects using VS Code.<br><br>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you. Your assistance would be immensely valuable in helping me overcome this hurdle and continue my Python learning journey.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Muhammad Ali <br>Chakwal, Pakistan
mera sach me numm ho gyi....Ankha :D

Harry...you are not making  good videos of courses after 80th...not understandable.....we are confused...you are just completeting videos..plz help us in these 20 videos
Subject: Need Help with VS Code and File Management<br><br>Dear Harry,<br><br>I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and express my appreciation for your fantastic &quot;100 Days of Code in Python&quot; series on Replit. It has been an invaluable resource for someone like me who is eager to learn and improve their Python programming skills. Your teaching style is clear and engaging, and I have learned a lot from your tutorials.<br><br>While I have been able to follow along and understand most of the concepts you&#39;ve covered, I have encountered a particular issue when attempting to replicate some of your examples in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Specifically, I am having trouble with the file management aspects, especially when you use the &quot;shutil&quot; module to create and manipulate multiple files.<br><br>In Replit, it seems quite straightforward, but when I attempt to do the same in VS Code, I encounter challenges that I&#39;m struggling to overcome. I believe there might be some differences in how file operations work or how the file structure is managed in VS Code compared to Replit.<br><br>I was wondering if you could provide some guidance or advice on how to handle file operations, particularly with the &quot;shutil&quot; module, within the VS Code environment. Any tips, best practices, or resources you could recommend would be greatly appreciated. I want to ensure that I can effectively apply the concepts you&#39;ve taught in my own projects using VS Code.<br><br>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you. Your assistance would be immensely valuable in helping me overcome this hurdle and continue my Python learning journey.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Muhammad Ali <br>Chakwal, Pakistan
Bahut sahi
Thank you so much sir for this video

From this idea i maked a timer that shows you a notification with sound after your given time here&#39;s the code:<br>import pygame<br>import time<br>from plyer import notification<br>import threading<br><br>def sound():<br>    # Initialize Pygame<br>    pygame.init()<br><br>    # Load the audio file<br>    audio_file = &quot;C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/All Python Programs/STOPWATCH/ALARM.mp3&quot;<br><br>    # Initialize the audio mixer<br>    pygame.mixer.init()<br><br>    # Load the audio file into a Sound object<br>    sound = pygame.mixer.Sound(audio_file)<br><br>    # Play the audio<br>    sound.play()<br><br>    # Wait for the sound to finish playing<br>    pygame.time.wait(int(sound.get_length() * 1000))<br><br>    # Cleanup and quit<br>    pygame.mixer.quit()<br>    pygame.quit()<br><br><br>def ALARM():<br>    if <i>_name_</i> == &quot;__main__&quot;:<br>        notification.notify(<br>            title = &quot;ALARM&quot;,<br>            message = &quot;Your timer Has completed !!&quot;,<br>            app_icon = &quot;C://Users//Administrator//Desktop//All Python Programs//STOPWATCH//Clock.ico&quot;,<br>            app_name = &quot;something&quot;,<br>            timeout = 4<br>        )<br><br>options = input(&quot;DO you want to choose it in (seconds/Minutes/Hours) : &quot;).lower()<br>user = int(input(&quot;Enter the value of timer : &quot;))<br><br>if options == &quot;s&quot; or options == &quot;seconds&quot;:<br>    for i in range(user):<br>        time.sleep(1)<br>         <br><br>elif options == &quot;m&quot; or options == &quot;minutes&quot;:<br>    user = user*60<br>    for i in range(user):<br>        time.sleep(1)<br>        <br><br>elif options == &quot;h&quot; or options == &quot;hours&quot;:<br>    user = user*60*60<br>    for i in range(user):<br>        time.sleep(1)<br><br><br># thread to play the sound<br>sound_thread = threading.Thread(target=sound)<br>sound_thread.start()<br><br># thread to display the notification<br>notification_thread = threading.Thread(target=ALARM)<br>notification_thread.start()<br><br># Wait for both threads to finish<br>sound_thread.join()<br>notification_thread.join()<br><br>print(&quot;Your timer Has completed !!&quot;)

At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgoB3_-ejnI&amp;t=4m04s"">4:04</a> why did func2 get printed before func1 ??

Harry one question<br>Is multithreading is same as asynchronous?
Anyone needing more help, join refers to joining that specific thread with the main thread. If we&#39;re not joining with the main thread, then the time it shows is the actual execution time of the main thread. But if we join, then it shows the actual time it took for all the threads to finish execution at the same time and then merged with the main thread using join() method.
thanku harry bro i just easily understand this where no one explain where harry can explain
Slowest step is rate determining step(rds)
Haryyy bhaii❤
Legend
You have told same example as async
Sir, can we do ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING in place of THREADING ???
ma ny ye learn kr li thi but aj kl zyada demand django or flask ki ha simple bht kam ha
I am watching this as 500 urls are getting downloaded without threading 🥲<br><br>I know what I am making my next PR for
You are amazing, MashaAllah! Allah bless you!

Hi Harry, Actually I am in a very big bad situation, I am developing a website which is python web crawling based, I have 12 crawlers which i need to run in every 10 seconds and send the results to the users.<br><br>So I am very confused about how to start that crawler if i start one by one by using windows task scheduler that is taking to log time if i am using multiprocessing and I also maintain the task status bcz i need to send an email  once all crawling done. that is very big confusion for me please help.

Analogy: You need to dry five shirts. Each shirt takes 5 minutes. If you let them for drying individually, then they are going to take 25 minutes and if you dry them simultaneously, they are going to take 5 minutes. <br>So drying up five shirts simultaneously is the same as doing multithreading...

Time to reveiw this course now
For those who are unable to run this code in windows try writing the part inside first &#39;for loop&#39; like this:<br>.... <br>.... <br>If __name__==&#39;__main__&#39;:<br>    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=downloadFile, args=[url, i]) <br>    p.start() <br>    pros.append (p)
umm... for some reason Multiprocessing doesnt work in my program<br>I used time.perf_counter to check and found out that mulltiprocessing actually takes more time than the normal download command
Your videos help me refresh my concept. Hats off sir.

Hello Sir,<br>I have a use scenario for this. I tried reaching out to you via email, but couldn&#39;t find any..<br>-- I need a help regarding running this feature on large scale.<br>-- How to use this feature in class??<br>I have a python program which does image processing as a batch process. Each process takes around 4 hours. Since I have a workstation, so I can utilise multiprocessing easily. <br>I tried using multiprocessing, but it didn&#39;t work as expected.<br><br>-- code is like this..<br><br>I have a tkinter application. In the main class, after doing some checks, processing starts, one by one and shows prompt like process 1 started, 2 started etc).<br>I have suppose 16 processes to run, but I want only 4 to run in parallel.<br>All I want is, program should not wait for all the process to complete to show the result. It should start showing the result one by one as process gets completed one after another (like process 1 got completed, 2 got completed etc). Kindly help me regarding that.
thankas bhaiya
This code is not work on windows<br>I use   : if <i>_name_</i> = &#39;__main__&#39; <br><br>Before <br>  for i in range (5):<br>     p = multiprocessing........

You’re awesome, but I noticed at Day-1 views count is 2.4 million and at Day-99 it’s 22K only.. Seems something is missing…I’m trying to understand why people leave such a good Program in between… almost 99% people left the program, whereas I found it informative and little boring after Day-27. Anyways - Happy Coding.
Sir can you please make a video on GUI in Python <br>You have an video on this but that is 4 or 5 years old<br>So, Can you make a new series for it
❤
Thank you Harry bhai for this course. It&#39;s a great course for python👍
2.3M people started this course,less than 17k were able to complete ,that is less than 0.7%.
Has anyone find the pdf of two books recommended in video (latest version)
Been a great journey bhai , loved to learn my first language of coding.
same course on c++
Thank you Harry Bhai for this amazing learning session for free of cost ❤. I learned many things for you. Bhai ek  request hai ki please woh jo documents hai na sare lectures ka replit mai, usko merge kr ke post/ upload kardo na please.

Legends are watching this in 2023 🤣🤣. Legends like karo👉
In Python, a set is a mutable data type.<br>Mutable objects allow modifications to their state<br><br>my_set = {1, 2, 3}<br>print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}<br><br>my_set.add(4)<br>print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}<br><br>my_set.remove(2)<br>print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3, 4}

thanks man
THANK YOU SIR
Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense like some other programming languages. In Python, you can define multiple methods with the same name in a class, but the method that gets executed will be based on the number of arguments passed during the function call. This is known as &quot;overloading by default.&quot; However, you cannot have multiple methods with the same name but different argument types like you would in languages with explicit method overloading.<br><br>class Calculator:<br>    def add(self, a, b):<br>        return a + b<br><br>    def add(self, a, b, c):<br>        return a + b + c<br><br># In this case, only the second add method will be available.<br># The first add method is overridden, and you can only use the one that takes three arguments.<br># This is because Python supports method overloading by default based on the number of arguments.
Superb video sir
Python does not allow method overloading
Sir make video <i>_iter_</i> and <i>_next_</i>  method

Haw to save database in sql
Sir if we have 100 stock and we put 51 the it is also showing sorry out of stock... jabki 51 is less than 100. if my stock is 200 and I am putting 101 then it is also showing out of stock
👍 great
why do you write your titles in English and speak in different language, this wastes users time and clutter the search. would it not be easier to write the title in your language so it does not bother others.
Bohot hard hai yaar
Source code?
Thanks sir for your teaching skills.....
sir stock ko run krne ke liye self.stock but pr q ko direct class ke method m call kra kyu
Thanks Sir 😊
in this project if user took 10 bikes and again want more 10 bikes then stock showing 90 bikes available. plz rectify this and tell me how to solve this issue <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wscubetech"">#wscubetech</a>

Sir why we need to use sqlite3 in python? Ager hum database ko Command prompt me sqlite run kerke bhi bana sakte hai.
sir sqlite file jb run krty hain tu  wahan st_id ki jaga None a jata hai<br>please reply sir
sir this is the right code<br>import sqlite3<br>conn=sqlite3.connect(&quot;sqlite1.db&quot;)<br>conn.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;<br>         Create Table Student (<br>              st_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, # &lt;-- fixed here<br>              st_name VARCHAR(50),<br>              st_class VARCHAR(10),<br>              st_email VARCHAR(30)<br>         )              <br>             <br> &#39;&#39;&#39;)<br> conn.close()<br><br>I noticed that you are using AUTO_INCREMENT for the st_id column. This is not supported by SQLite, which uses a different mechanism for generating primary keys. You need to use INTEGER PRIMARY KEY instead, which will automatically assign a unique integer value to each row. This will also make your table more efficient and compatible with other databases. To fix this, you need to change the st_id column definition to INTEGER PRIMARY KEY<br> I hope it&#39;s ok to give feedback, great channel by the way, the biggest benefit of this channel is the Indian voice, learning from English channels becomes tedious due to their dull voices, thank you for this material.
