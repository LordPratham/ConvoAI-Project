Keep your good work on.... Hope some day we can have a talk/chat

This could be dangerous exercise. He says it can make your finger hurt. pff no one will care about pain but if overdone it might cause carpal tunnel, so be super careful.
💯👍🔥
Are some of the videos to this course hidden? Needing a subscription to watch? Found the intro lessons very helpful

Hey You! Yes you! Today is guru Purnima and As we know it hurts that the course is no longer available on YouTube,can we honour our Guru with the donations? We all somewhere feel guilty for not supporting him so can we make his day by the smallest of contributions? I mean not to change his mind about his decision but to feel less guilty and to uplift him too as he is so sad. Please please please donate via patym ,PayPal or anything to the details given in his discription box. Let&#39;s make his day you guys. We are not this mean,are we?

Hey You! Yes you! Today is guru Purnima and As we know it hurts that the course is no longer available on YouTube,can we honour our Guru with the donations?

Stuff that I am interested in cannot possibly be played on an Acoustic guitar :(. Also, an electric guitar can be made to sound like an acoustic to a pretty good extent so I went with an electric.

Very nice teaching sir
Hi Adit<br>I really like the way you explain things, you have taken the guitar lessons to a next level and it feels more like guitar engineering.<br>I had a question..<br>I used to play guitar 6 years back when I was not good at playing leads but I was well at strumming. Now these 6 years have been no touch guitar for me, and now I decided to pick where I left, I know I need a lot of practice to get back to what I was. And I am sure by following you not just would I be able to achieve that but enhance my skills and knowledge.<br>I have already bought a new guitar and I wanted to take your suggestion how are these guitars? It is - LAG TRAMONTANE T70A, I mean only if you are familiar. I went to buy fender CD60sce but got this one instead as I liked it more. Please advice.
I was going to buy a yamaha f310 but I bought a techno guitar because it was more comfortable but expensive than yamaha
love the way you say HOYEGA.

Hii I joined ur guitar classes in EFA Course. I learn D major and A major code. I am more comfortable while playing and changing code A. ( Frist finger  3 string 2 Fred, middle finger 4th string 2nd Fred and ring finger 2nd string 2nd Fred .) And u teach like use of middle, ring and little fingers. While use this tacheniq fill very uncomfortable. Can I continue with Frist techniques??????
Sir trying to call you no one answered the call how can I get in touch with you
Umm the speed was so high. Had to watch in 0.75x speed 😂but the explanation outstanding and mind-blowing
the fret marker uses a concept called indexing quite well know in computer science field. It helps you to search a file in a large store and works on the same concept as sir told in this session. Sorry for my geeky comment but I found it quite interesting to point that out.
Hi
God bless you sir.

For the physicists, frequency of a string=(1/2*pi)*sqrt(mu/l), where mu=mass per unit length.<br><br>So, if length decreases, frequency increases.

Thanku sir 😊
Brother please make a lesson on how to identify the chords by listening a song
Thank u sir
Sir Where are you from and where is your Music/Guitar Class?
Very good information sir, I really appreciate your videos...<br><br>Basically<br> frequency is inversely proportional  to the length.....,LESS LENGTH WOULD BE, THE MORE FREQUENCY IT HAS MEANS HIGH PITCHED SOUND.....<br><br>Also depends upon the tension...<br>Frequency is directly proportional to the square root of tension, THE MORE YOU TIGHTENS IT, THE MORE YOU GET HIGH PITCHED SOND.....<br><br>Also, it depends upon the radius of string, Frequency is inversely proportional to radius of string......MORE RADIUS, LESS FREQUENCY SOUND....<br><br>Lastly, because of the forced vibration, it produce the loud sound of higher amplitude and from the hollow box...
Awesome 💕👌
Sir please suggest me a guitar budget is 4-6 thousand for beginners

shiddat title track guitar
Do we need to lose tuning keys after the end of the day ?
At the outset I would like to congratulate you for taking up this noble effort of guiding the guiter enthusiast or potential aspiring guiter player. This is the most practical and accurate method of guiter tutorial where the physical and postural aspects of guiter learning are explained in a very candid yet accurate way. This is the foundation of guiter learning. Without this knowledge and sense, one ends up leaving the course halfway or becoming a unskilled player. I am 59 years old and I love Spanish guiter tremendously but I took up the learning course thrice before and left being fed up with no proper progress. What I noticed in your is that all my previous teachers didn&#39;t render an overview of physical technics which is utmost important and without which one cannot build up solo playing skill specially. I will join your class to give a last ditch attempt, cheers!! 👍

Do we need to press the strings whils say playing in 1st fret... do ww need to hold n press the string
Thanks a lot for free lessons starting from the very beginning. One issue which I ve been facing is the consciousness of on which string my fingers are without looking at them. Is there any trick for that or does it comes with practice. Love from across the border

Every beautiful girl deserve an eye😅 is the perfect way to remember
For piano it&#39;s different formula which makes harder for me to keep those notes names in mind 😭 So while sight reading we get 5 letters for lines E, G, B, D, F which my style of remembering that is &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves F*<b>*&quot; 😂😂and 4 letters for spaces F, A, C, E which is easy to remember similarly for the bass clef its again G, B, D, F, A and I&#39;ll remember it like &quot;Good Boy Deserves F**</b> Animals &quot; 😂😂 and for the bass it&#39;s A, C, E, G &quot;All Cows Eats Grass&quot;
sir how to adjust the tightness of the wires please tell. i feel the sound of your guiter and mine are different.

Sir the thing is my guitar has 5 strings so will it be a problem without the 6th string
EBGDAE- Every beautiful girl deserves an eye ☺☺☺
Hello Sir<br>I just got confused with respect to the last video, wherein you were telling bout the frets. The question is, when you say we have to press on the frets, as per your example which was with middle finger, 4th string, 5th fret; when I’m pressing the fret the string is also coming with it and the sound is not produced 🤯 I hope you understood my ques as I didn’t honestly but please help 😫
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
&quot;Every beautiful girl deserves an eye&quot; Will work sir 😅 numbering from 6-1
Hi, i was going through your lessons... and found the formulae very interesting.. well i have heard one more formula for the same..it goes like- Every Beautiful Girl Deserves An Eye.. haha just sharing.

The entire thing was damn great. Just, I was looking for you to sort of give a tutorial using the digital tuner as well. I kinda had to search for a different video (POV: it was my first time using a tuner so I didn&#39;t know anything about it). So, it&#39;d be great if you could add that to your series as well.
Thank you so much😊❤
Love u bro.. I can&#39;t explain  my happiness by words ..just thank u so much

Hi Adit, firstly thanks for making this wonderful video series available for beginners. It&#39;s really helpful. Regarding Guitar Tunning, I need to know should we untune the guitar when keeping it back in cover for the day? Or we should only do this when Guitar not in use for few days or it&#39;s completely not required and we can always keep our Guitar back in tuned mode?
I broke the B string during tuning.
Why i am not able to see few videos, some of them are showing private video.

But whenever I use the app to tune its showing the wrong cords when I play E the app shows B. What to do please help me ?
Nice one sir ji 😘😘😘😘
Thank you so much 🙏

Adit, when I tune my guitar there is a loud <b>ting</b> sound, and it seems to be coming from the strings. Is that normal or is something wrong with my guitar?<br>Edit : The sound doesn&#39;t seem to affect the guitar and I am able to tune it perfectly. Just wondering if the loud sound is normal.
Apke guitar konsa model hai or budget kitna hai?
Sir how would the phone be connected to a non electric guitar?
Hi sir i hope you will be fine .<br>Sir i want to tel you mery guitar ki 6th string E2  pay tone hoe ha or 1st string E4 tone hoe ha so kindly tell me the solution 😥
Guiter tuna app mey tune auto mood me karein ya manual mood mey?
Clockwise minus<br>Anticlockwise plus!
Hey Adit. Just need a small favour. Is there anyway I can get in contact with you? Because I got a new guitar and just trying to tune 6 strings but string top E keeps making this snap sound when I tighten it and it goes back to square one. Please help me with this. I am just worried. Hope the guitar is not faulty because of this or it&#39;s just a small problem?
Awesome 👍
Sir.. Just by watching your single video I started trusting you because of the clarity and perfection in your explanation. Thank you sir.
Sir mera guitar d pr tune nhi ho rha tha..app se krne pr b pr show ho rha tha..tight krne pr toot gaya..but d pr tune nhi hua😕
<b>GuitarTuna is almost perfect for tuning. I use it</b> 😇
Hi sir,<br>Is it necessary to untune the guitar after practice?<br>Thank you.
Thanks buddy.. i dont know about sharp and flat..<br>After watching your video its easy now.. nd i m following your course too❣️
bhaya can u tell me , how do we get to know that we have reached our desired note ( i am a complete beginner)
Hey man, after watching this video I was trying to tune my guitar. I was trying to tune 4th string to note D by loosening the string as it was in E. But the case was on loosening, it would loosen so much that it would start touching the fretboard. So I went higher and tighten it till I reach D. When I reached D, string was too tighten and caused difficulty in pressing. Same was the case with string 1 &amp; 2. Do you have any way out for this scenario?
Best explanation. Thanks for your efforts!
So practically you are describing everything... So nice sir ... I am learning gradually... :)
Sir humare app mein is tarah sound Nahi araha Hai tune hone par jaese aapke mein arahi Hai please please sir bataiye
Very nice sir
Thank you sir
I am learning something from you so when am stick any where in guitar I will let you know by comment
Sir you made a complete informative video in perfect sequence for beginner
Kya string tight karte karte tut sakta hai ya ye wapas se loose jo jata means circle way me ek point me bahot tight uske aage loose kya main sahi soch raha hu ?
sir aap please sharp and flat ke meanings further video mai describe krdejeyega
Bole to Rapchik hai sir :)
Sir jab hum. Guitar play nahi karte kuch dino tak to kya us duration mein hme. Strings ko loose kr dena chahiye ya fir tuned he chhod dena chahiye.<br><br>Please clear this doubt.
Thank you Adit. I don&#39;t think any other guitar channel tries to teach the basics while tying it with music theory. It&#39;s just a great way to connect the dots. Your lessons are always helpful.
Adit Bhai Lage raho &amp; Hum bhi sheekh ke he manenge💯✌️😉
sir a college fest mashup plz.... you can go for some tough cords not at all a prob;em but plz try to make mashup if possible...old songs with rendition would be superb

Thank You so much Sir 🙏🏼🙏🏼
It would be very nice if you could name your playlists in an organised way, so things are easy to find. eg: Day 1- lesson 1 of 5. Day 2 Lesson 1 of 3. and so on... the present name system, takes me all over youtube, and I have to stop and look for the next class. It&#39;s frustrating... You are brilliant, but the file naming is not. Ending on a positive again! You are absolutely a brilliant teacher!
Damn, u r underrated bud, people should know u, i am binge watching your series in this lockdown.
For strumming how to know whether it&#39;s from 3 to 1 string or vice versa...
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peqweS-aTAw&amp;t=8m44s"">8:44</a>, that sounds like still D.R.E
Sir string E,B,G  is treble or bass sorry I couldn&#39;t understand this properly , plz ans.
Sir, I don&#39;t understand how to place my fingers on the fret for playing a string. Can you please explain this to me? I am so confused about it. Whenever I place my finger on the fret and string, my string doesn&#39;t make any sound, it doesn&#39;t play. I really can&#39;t figure this out! Please help me.<br><br>And I love your lessons. I have been following and taking notes of your lessons regularly..You teach in a great way and it&#39;s really very delightful watching you and learning.<br>And I am here from Bangladesh. One of your online students😁
I started this course 2 days ago..i am learning alot

Hello sir I am finding easy to hold pick with middle finger and thumb is it OK?
Hey adit ..I knew how to play guitar and after so many years i again wanted to play but my fingers were not supporting the call....i am starting from the scratch now...and i find your videos really helpful thank you bro...god bless you 🙏🙏
Thanks a lot for the intricately detailed guitar lessons sir😁!!! Your videos should really receive more views!! I have been self-learning guitar for almost a year now and your videos have helped me correct loads of mistakes. I realised I was holding my pick with three fingers until very recently so I googled around. Some told it was quite wrong while others told that it&#39;s a personal preference.I have been trying to change to two fingers but the transition is getting painful. So can you please advice if I have to continue to change to two fingers or remain with three since I also seem to write with a pen using three fingers. <br>Thank you😊
Yaar pta nhi apke videos pr itne viewa kyu nhi aate they are awesome <br>Good job

Hi sir aapka course join krne k baad kitne dino tk videos dekh skte hai..??
U are best sir
Sir plz make ur videos public..
Sir ye jo day by day lessons h inme kafi videos private show kr rha h so inko fully watch k lie ky krna hoga all 30 days lessons ke liye
Probably the best tutorial on youtube.... But unfortunately your videos has gone private......😢
Thanks you sir
Sir why did you make the videos private... How do then we know that what your teaching style is so that we take uo your paid courses... Because you videos on youtube are quiet staggered and unlinked to each other.. so how do we go about understanding you teching methodoloy
Thank you sir<br>This was so much easy to understand and felt so confident playing guitar🤗
Is it necessary that our fingers reach sound hole? as when i follow the suggestion you gave to rest palm on saddle, when i do so my fingers don&#39;t reach sound hole, would it be a good practice to continue in this way?
Ok
❤️
Why the further videos are set to private???
Which is guitar useing u sir
Sir, why are your other videos private I want to see them all it would be really nice of you if you make them all public.
Thank you sir 😊
Hello sir,<br>I have a 39 inch guitar and it&#39;s pretty hard to get comfortable while placing hand on  the saddle because of the guitar&#39;s small size. So, could you recommend its alternative.
The structure you follow is really appreciable. Lot to learn from you Sir!! Shukriya
Thanks a lot
Sir I guess earlier  your videos were free but now they are private why so
I followed that armrest on saddle/bridge pins. I am feeling a strain in my bicep muscles. Maybe because I am unable to give them a rest. First I didn&#39;t rest my arm, that time, there was no problem with muscles. But when I am doing this. I am feeling pain in it. Might be because my arms are long or my guitar is short for me. Or my way is wrong. Can you include this - how-to rest avoid pain? or a bicep-rest 30-second tutorial or how to place the right hand on the guitar properly? in your next video? I am not saying a separate video. You can add this point to your upcoming video. As you wish. Thank you! 😊
Sir apne bohot sari videos is lessons ki kyu delete krdi
Hi Adit, I really liked your lessons but some of the videos in your course are private. Is there any way to access those ?
Sir start kab hoga asli guitar bjana ... Ye sb aata h
I have a habit of placing little finger below 1st string for support<br>Should I continue doing that or change it
i have a guitar last few years. but was not able to figure out how to proceed. after watching all these videos i feel confident, that even i can play guitar. and bass guitar. everytime as a teacher your encouragement says &quot;its never late....&quot; really motivating...!!! <br> god bless you buddy. thanks a ton for all these videos.
Do we need to rest the palm? Can we keep it hanging?
Sir, actually when putting my palm on the place which u said....but when i am doing this, my fingers doesnt reached to sound hole and my palm touches the string.....it seems very difficult for me to put my palm on that.....can u plz give me a solution for this issue
Thanks it&#39;s really helpful sir
Hi Adit, in this lesson you talked about placement of ur paln on the bridge pins, but what if my guitar doesn&#39;t have bridge pins? I am finding it difficult where to place my hand coz m just ending up muting the strings
I want your course....how do i get...?
Is it necessary to rest the right hand on the bridge? I can&#39;t find that comfortable position whatsoever!
very clear
adit sir you are best teacher sir...i was practising for last 2 months aimlessly but after watching your videos, I can feel that i am progressing in the right direction
Thanks Adit...
Thank you
I cant find my sweet spot.<br>I mean, if I&#39;m placing my palm on the saddle, my hand isn&#39;t reaching to the sound hole.
Thanks a lot... I am going through ur lesson
Love u sir❤❤
2.19. Bilkul sahi baat kahi single ladko k liye😂🚶
Hi Adit. You surely are doing a great job. Your confidence in your work kind of motivates me and makes me put some some extra efforts than usual. Just having some problem with my hand placement. I am having a 39 inch guitar (Ibanez md39c). Cause of the size m unable to place my hand on the bridge pins. It is giving me a very awkward position and also making my shoulder pain a bit. Could you please suggest me how to hold it in a better position. It would be much appreciated.
Sir I am feeling lucky to find you on YouTube Today. 😍😍
u r the great sir

Just to clarify,  while strumming we have to play exact string as we have learnt for A-major or else all the six strings have to be strummed?
Sir m ek months s uper s guitar practice kr rhi hu  but still I m unable to change chord smoothly ek ek fingers soch soch k raktie hu abhi bhi 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Bilkul Sahi bola sir apne mujhe hasi aa mera bhi kuch aise hi hota hai but m follow you and your tips daily I hope ki mi bhi achha bja saku
Bro meri struming gndi aari h...kya kru?
Areee vaaaaaH...<br>1No...sir...
Hello sir when I strum my right hand misses the stroke sometimes or I strum some strokes too hard please help me with it!
Brother.. Apke lessons seniority me nhi nikal rhe hain. Lessons ko seniority me kaise nikal skte hain...??
Have a doubt sir, do i have to strum on all the 6 strings while changing the chords or only 4-1 in D &amp; 5-1 in A??
I hv a doubt jaise ki apne tha A chord play krte tym upr wali string nhi use krte nd D k tym last 4 play krte hain toh iss struming mein bhi waise krna hai ya all 6 chords play krni hai??
Was really a awesome lesson sir😀"

One thing I would want to say....I came accross this treasure during the 2nd half  of the Quarantine and was enjoying it and it is too good of a teaching available all over YouTube. Didn&#39;t knew what metronome was, learnt how to use it from you...then when I was near the 10 finger exercise for right hand video my work started, and today I came back to learn more, I see many of your videos have been made private...I won&#39;t say it is wrong... You are doing a great job by providing all these awesome tutorial for free....I would just requested you to make those video public again... would love to learn from you.... Thankyou Very much for all the knowledge you are sharing..Stay Safe and God Bless you.. Peace ✌🏻

I don&#39;t know what exactly your present situation is,,probably it&#39;s too hard,otherwise you won&#39;t delete the vedios.<br>But your vedios were too helpful for me. I am from a muslim family of Bangladesh. My family doesn&#39;t support learning guitar at all. In this situation your vedios were a lot to me, but it was unfortunate for you and me as well that none of the people donated and supported you. I pray to allah that he makes you happy.

Guys, Iss paid course ko khareedne se achha  go watch &quot;Acoustic pahadi&quot; .
Those who are supporting adit for paid courses in the comment section are either fake accounts of adit or they have already watched the lessons when it wasnt private toh unko farak nahi paddta isliye yaha shakkar gira rahe 😂

Sir aapne guitar course ki video private kyu ki plssss ans 🙏🙏
I just made a comment on your old video,  which was the one where you showed to play  first 3 songs using A, D and E chord, now that I saw this video I can understand why you made those video private, I won&#39;t say you to make them public or anything, I wish you all the best and will definitely buy this course once I clear the 1st stage of learning, and when I am ready to spend 4k. And believe me 4k for lifetime is a very good deal rather than 1k for only 4 or 8 sessions per month where each session is only for 1 hr... Where it take 5-10 mins to tune the guitar🤣.  Thankyou and keep up the great work.
Sir is this course after the 30 day course ?? <br>Because a lot of videos for the 30 days course have been made private <br>And sir will these videos be enough to be an intermediate player?

Hello sir, I really appreciate your work. I tried playing your guitar lessons course playlist and most of the videos are showing private video. Please look into it
Hi I’m not sure which class to opt for- the 4K or 2.5 k . What really is the difference ? And what’s best for long term ?
Bhai stage 1 ke bhi maximum videos private kr diye hain, bhai jhooth boht bolta hai, stage 1 ke course ke starting mai bolla thha bhai ne ki free chlegga
4K for lifetime ? Give up your<br>Netflix for 6Months or Cigarettes for 5 Months or Gym for 3months...so on all your bad habits guys but never negotiate on price for art.<br>His teaching skills is priceless ❣.

Sir ye course music composition pe based he kya ? Aur kya ye complete  course he composition ka ?
Sir, I really got improved by the exercises you have told it hepled me alot but in your playlist for beginner of 69 videos some videos are missing are those videos included to course which you hv mentioned in this video. Plzz reply me for this concern, after so long search of guitar lessons i finally got a mentor for learning, i want to learn it from basics, Plzz reply for this concern. Thank you. 😊
singing video kar ne kay leya kon sa microphone   best ha vi
Sir pls tell me<br><br>No. Of lessons in this course..?
Well, as far as my experience is concerned with the Practical Music Theory course, I am quite familiar with everything explained in this masterclass. I have been learning Indian Classical music as well as some western theory, and I believe that Indian Classical is a much better approach to understand the ins and outs of music. The concept of modes can be better understood by doing a similar concept of thaats in Indian Classical. So, our Indian Classical music has everything in it to become a great composer or musician. I opted for this course to learn music composition in particular, and I didn’t expect anything from the beginner and intermediate levels of the course but definitely something in the advanced level, and I was waiting throughout the entire masterclass to get any information which can enhance my composing ability by learning something advanced/ extraordinary, which I am not doing yet but couldn’t find anything different. So, I believe this was not for me. Also, in my opinion, music composition, most of the times, is not only using some exceptional or borrowed chords. It is an emotional connection you can generate even with all the natural notes/ chords too; you just need a vision to see a world in those simple natural notes. Believe me, it’s not that complicated as most of the Bollywood songs use just chords which are in major scale, and they sound so pleasing, which is enough to prove my point. <br>However, I want to tell someone who is unsure about how music really works can buy this course. Not a bad course for someone who is not able to find chord structures of a song or practically understand a composition but this is definitely not for me as I do not need it. Thanks.
Never stop please ❤️
Sir will I be able to crack scale, chords, tabs of any song after going through the course coz I want to join ?
Best thing you said that<br>Every musicians can&#39;t be a good teacher! And you are both in one teacher and musician❤🔥
Hello Adit sir! Being a student I can&#39;t purchase this course as I don&#39;t earn but I can surely analyse that this course is something that can take one to it&#39;s proper way!<br>You are aweosme sir❤
Sir please reply, <br>I wanna purchase this course but I don&#39;t have credit card and PayPal isn&#39;t working.. <br>What should I do??? <br>Please give me the way to purchase it. <br>If you have Gpay phonepay paytm or debit card facility then I will purchase.
Sir Gpay ka option dijiye purchase karne k liye main purchase Karna chahta hoon
Sir how many videos are there in this course?
Kya aapke is course se mai ,gane ke lead and chords find kar pauga !<br>No ear training<br>Mere kaan bilkul b ache nhi hai ...nothing about ear training....<br>Kya mai fir b isse gaane ke tabs chords nikaal paauga ?

Hi Adit, I am planning to purchase ur paid guitar course. However can u pl help me understand whether this music theory course should be done before that?
Have some further doubts about the course. Can I contact you anywhere?
Hello Sir. I want to purchase your practical music theory course. But on the payment page there are only two options credit card and PayPal. I have only debit card. How do I make payment?
Mai bilkul beginner hu to mujhe suru se samajna Hai to kese samju kya Karu plss kuch bataye plss  🙏 🙏
Is your theory website not secured?
hare krishna, sir, why dont you start the full course,  bez your teaching is really easy and understanding, the way of teaching is very great. my simple request  is please try  to  teach advance course like this 30 days learning. hoping i will  do this for our country,  our country deserves a good trainer like you. hoping you will do this for who are interested in learning the Guitar but not in position to pay you.
Sir,  in this course will i learn  intermediate guitar lessons also ? If I purchase 🤔🤔
Sir, pls play &#39;Neon&#39; by John Mayer😄
Sir i have a doubt..kindly clear.its in day 27 lesson 2 and lesson 3. In day 27 lesson 2 you said while playing c chord that shifting one fret to the right does not make it c#, thats no chord but in day 27 lesson 3 you said that c<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23m"">#m</a> can be played shifting one fret right &amp; play Cm makes it c<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23m"">#m</a>..you said in this lesson that shifting to one fret makes it # and shifting one fret left makes is b(flat). Thats just opposite.please clarify
Sir I had doubt that whether we have to pay at once or monthly...and can we pay through payment apps like phone pay etc..<br>Hope u clear my doubts...
After going through your beginner course, i would like to go further for some advance course. Among all youtube videos and classes, i found your classes very helpful for me. Will look further to join your paid course.

Thanks sir for launching this course i will definitely buy this after my boards. 😍😍🙏🙏<br><br>Edit : sir aap scales bhi sikhaoge kya is course me
The day i was waiting for ! 🙏🙏 exactly what we want theory is everything and no new thing we always expect something new from you and you did it ! 💞💞 thanks in advance 😃
Hello Guys...First of all THANKS a lot to Adit Sir for making this course for us. Sofar I have just watched 3 vdos and its just fantastic , every single thing is just entering the brain like a so clearly. This is a pay course guys. I think that its fair that this course or any courses of this kaliber do have a price. Believe me this  price is infact much less then the knowledge we are getting here. Nobody is forced to buy anything , so like Sir already told us, in his vdo, that if u want to invest in you, and want to improve your playing skills by understanding the music theory concepts, and that to in a very easy way ...you just go for this course man !!  Last think,  it is just like going to small , when some of us telling Adit sir to not charge any thing for his work here, but its a big and cool  thing that Sir still do answer that kind of messeges, and that too in a proper way.  RESPECT.  ENJOY your music journey my Dear Guitar Bros, guitar and love is all we need ❤🎸🎼🎶✌🎵🙏
Sir, will this course last till 17 March??. Cause my parents told it to buy it and work on it after my tenth and my boards will get over on 17 March😅😅😅😅😅.
For how many days would be this course valid?
Hi Adit, This is Vishnu.  I’ve been a huge fan and follower of you from day 1. Its been an amazing journey with you learning guitar and singing amazing songs for me. This course will be a sure shot gold and I will br signing up for the same due to your sheer genuinity and efforts that you put in for your videos. <br><br>And I agree to thr fact this course is priced. Essential valuable knowledge shouldn’t be of high price but it when it comes with bearable price, people who value the same will take it with all their heart. <br><br>To the people who complain, come on guys! <br><br>Cheers Adit, respect you ! 😊

Adit&#39;s Guitar Lessons  hey 1 min I know it takes effort to make videos. And for that effort u earn money also. Effort is used in everything whether it be doing job or making videos. And u earn from YouTube. And if u keep music theory videos free then more and more people would be able to access it and learn something new. And there will be more views and u will gradually earn more. If u will keep them paid maybe u earn more but only very few people would see it. I don&#39;t know whether u are here to only make money or share ur knowledge with others. <br>And one more thing u said about free music theory in ur 1 video where u said after getting 5k likes on that video u will make free music theory lessons.<br>And 1 more thing donation na force krke ya beekh mangkr nahi le jaate wo mrzi se de jaate hai <br>I m sorry if ur hurt. I fully respect u. U can do whatever u want. It was just my suggestion so that every person can gain some knowledge from ur knowledge.
eagerly waiting
its nice bt. i can&#39;t purchase uR <a href=""http://course.im/"">course.im</a> a student.its costly. tc sir
Waiting a lot
Bhai Pehle like aur comment ka toh nahi pata, I am hope I am pehla one to join ;)
Very thoughtful sir . Excited to learn!
How to play any songs lead on guitar...?
Tysmm sir...so excited for it♥️♥️♥️♥️
Sir <br>Is it a one time Pay<br>Or a periodic Subscription?
Let me remind y&#39;all <br>Not many YouTuber think about us...Respect
Thank you Sir
How to pay in rupees. There is no such link. It shows only dollar
I just checked the course and it&#39;s content and trust me; <br>This course is more than awesome<br>It is very good in every aspect like content and all<br>And best part about this course is PRICE ; the price is very very less in comparison to the knowledge and benefits you are going to gain.<br>For example it&#39;s like you are getting premium pizza at the cost of regular price.<br>100% recommended Go and buy it.<br>As per me; it is actually an INVESTMENT which will give you high returns in future and if you applied the knowledge in right manner your COST will get RECOVERED in FIRST ATTEMPT of your project.<br>Good luck guys!!
Thank you so much sir

I love rock and alternative rock and I never had any interest in learning guitar but then as my music taste grew.... after listening to lots of Great artists, i just loved every guitar riff, listend to them a lot searched the covers for these. and somehow i wanted to learn it.....it&#39;s like I appreciated it so much that I wanted to learn it  and I got it a week ago and started your course....it&#39;s going well but my fingers hurt a lot.... unfortunately I need sensitive finger tips cause I&#39;m a med student...so I&#39;m buying finger guards hopefully that I&#39;ll help me .
Sir aap english song nhi bajate hay
Firstly I am a music lover and not a musician and since too much of music generally makes you want to play. So i try to strum a little once in a while. Always loved your channel n your video about “the trick thats going to change your life” was a real eye opener. But today this video was a great surprise for me to see playlists with Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains stuff. Really meant a lot. Me being a music explorer irrespective of place, language and sometimes genre, look out for independent artists rather than new bollywood shit (with no disregard to old hindi film songs we’ve grown up listening to). But somehow its been almost 20 yrs and still guitar and blues n all sub-genres of guitar led music turns me on like anything. I can talk for hours if its about music n artists. I don’t know why am i rambling like this. Maybe because i felt a kind of connect regarding true music love n respect. 👍🏻👍🏻 for your lessons and videos.
Dear Sir Adit,<br><br>I have been following you for a quite a while you are doing tremendous help to all... Love you for that......<br><br>I need a help from your vast knowledge and experience<br><br>I have been playing guitar for 2 years now, but I&#39;m stuck at a point (I&#39;m unable navigate up &amp; down on neck on a precise fret)<br><br>Please help me solve this.... What should I do to master the fret jumps precisely<br><br>Please help me....!!!!
