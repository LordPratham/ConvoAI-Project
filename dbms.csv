Thanks sir
Very Nice Explanation Sir , Thank You !
sir salute to you you are blessing to us
What is redundancy DBMS?<br>Redundancy, in the context of a DBMS, occurs when the same data is stored in multiple locations within a database. It can arise due to various reasons, such as denormalized database design, a lack of proper data modeling, and the replication of data for backup or distribution purposes.   It is also used for backup purposes if in case there is a crash and to protect data from permanently being lost.

Whatever you explain that is very nice after that u should summarize end of the video 😊
Aap example se bahut ache se padhate h but usme thoda theory likh ke samjhate to notes bhi ban jata  .
Sir, why do we need to bring the entire file? Can&#39;t we search for the data which is required in the particular file and then return it? Then wouldn&#39;t it become the same as DBMS, though not as fast as DBMS?
Gand
Sir notes provide bhi kara do

Sir, I&#39;ve an idea:<br>While i was watching your video was facing too many ads. And got distracted, is it possible if any student is watching educational videos on YouTube then they will only get ads up to motivation commercials and not swiggy, chocolates.. etc etc because it is too  easy to get distracted through these ads if I&#39;ll get motivating ads from yt in middle of lectures that&#39;d be great 🤔

Hello, there seems to be confusion about what was said regarding changes to conceptual data not affecting the view level. If changes are made to the data type of a column, what will happen to the previously stored data?

You said each database have only one primary key but a database can contain multiple tables, and each table within the database can have its own primary key. However, within each individual table, there can only be one primary key. So a database can have multiple primary keys

Pranam Guruji 🙏😍
A course can have multiple students enrolled in it. So will it not be more efficient to use the course id as a foreign key in the student table?
how foreign key can accept null and duplicate values....
Can the name of foreign key and primary key be different ??
Please don&#39;t request for your channel to get subscribed ... jo nahi kar rahe unka hee loss hai ... ab koi khud apna loss karna chahata hai to .. ham log kya kare 😂😂
you replaced foreign key word with primary key? or I heard wrong
sir as we are using a foreign key while insertion if i inserted roll_number 10 not present in the refernced table but there in referncing table its not showing any error as u prescribed it should an error right?<br>its happenend when i created a new referencing table and placed the query like this:<br>roll_number int refernces student(roll_number);
Thanks alot sir for giving us amazing lectures 💕God bless Yuu.. we rr heartily thankful to Yuu.. ❤
Thank you sir ❤
Thank you 🤠☺️ good explanation sir..
Sir composite key aur candidate key same h ?
But in school there is not only one student of same roll no
Sir i have doubt when we have only 1 primary key then how foreign key can 2  because foreign key take reference by primary key. Sir please give me reply as soon as possible
Love you sir from Bangladesh
Hi Varun, You are amazing in explaining about RDMS concepts. All my doubts are clarified after watching your videos. Please keep up the good work going.
thanks sir...u r explaining with detail..
Foreign key me null value ho skta h??
Best of the best thanks sir for your hard efforts
So can we say that primary key to foreign key is a 1-1 relationship? 1-1, 2-2 but 3 !- 10

Sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyqpQ3D2yCw&amp;t=3m37s"">3:37</a> you said &quot;if we join any two tables then a relationship exists between them and that relationship is find through any one of the attribute should be same in both tables&quot; but after you wrote the SQL query for foreign key creation at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyqpQ3D2yCw&amp;t=8m05s"">8:05</a> you said that both primary key and foreign key have different attribute names not able understand that if the names are how we can make the relationships between the tables"

Summary of this video<br>The concept of foreign keys is important for maintaining referential integrity.<br><br>Referential integrity ensures that the data in related tables remains consistent.<br><br>There are three main operations: insertion, deletion, and updating.<br><br>Insertion in the referenced table does not create any violation.<br><br>Deletion in the referenced table may cause a violation, but it can be resolved using on delete cascade or on delete set null. -In the referencing table, insertion may cause a violation, deletion does not cause a violation, and updating can potentially cause a violation.

explanation part is simply superb but if u show the same practically it will help us to learn more thoroughly
If we insert new data in base table why it ll not affect  referencing table ? It has FK key which is pk in base table will it automatically update FK of referencing table of we insert new  data   in pk column of referenced table????
great teacher!!!
😵😵😵BCA student like here😵😵😵
Excellent Method
I have cleared the concept of data base management and about keys with the help of your videos. Please clear my query that if there should be a primary key then how can be there is more foriegn key . Please clear my doubt.
👌👌Sir aapki koi book ya notes bhi aate h kya Market m (for competitive exams)
I m preparing it for class 10 exam but it&#39;s surprised to knew that it is concept of that level😗
Superb!
Hi..<br>Suppose,i have a table &#39;A&#39; with five child table namely &#39;B&#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;D&#39;,&#39;E&#39;,&#39;F&#39;.<br>Now,i like to delete the records of &#39;A&#39; directly without deleting the child table one by one.<br>Here,the problem is that out of those five child tables one or more can have also child <a href=""http://tables.so/"">tables.So</a>,it is very difficult to go one by one and delete the all child tables followed by parent table.<br><br>Also,there is possibilities of adding one or more child table to any of those tables described above in later point of <a href=""http://time.in/"">time.In</a> that case my query which is developed at this moment will not work and i would get error of &#39;&#39;INTEGRITY CONSTRAINT VIOLATION&#39;&#39;.<br>Also,there is no provision of &#39;&#39;on delete cascade&#39;&#39; as per our available data model and<br>also it can&#39;t be modified right now.<br><br>So,please kindly help me to resolve the issue of deleting parent record without deleting the immediate child tables one by one and also the associated child tables of the immediate child tables if any one by one.
This lectures are far better than our college lectures.

Hello sir.. I have a question.  Is the Candidate key  known as super key??
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰❤️<br>Great work sir😊
Hello sir thanks for helping me
sir looking soo handsome in this lecture
Considering a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies ABC-&gt;DE and D-&gt; AB , what is the number of superkeys of R? Please solve this problem.
Sir you look like Lawrence Bishnoi 😂
is last question&#39;s answer correct?<br>if correct then explain it.
❤❤❤
You are a great teacher Sir.
Best
better then unacademy
Considering (a1a2), (a3a4) as the composite keys in the last example... shouldn&#39;t the answer be 2^(n-2) - 2^(n-4) ?? <br>Like if we take a1a2 -&gt; x and a3a4 -&gt; y, then we are left with only n-2 elements; now the question is similar to the first one with n-2 keys only...<br>Correct me if I am wrong.
Very well explained..thanku sir g
Super key mai 1 hi candidate key hogi ya multiple bhi ho sakti hai
Amazing sir 👏
Iska membership lene se kya hoga sir plzz tell me kya sb material provide hoga kha se milega what&#39;s app ya kha se???
<a href=""https://youtu.be/3WQ24w48Bzk"">https://youtu.be/3WQ24w48Bzk</a>
carry on brother huge respect for you many who cant afford teachers and less interest in reading books they can learn easily any topics from your videos ......
i love you
sir t shirt ka link dijiye mst lg rha h
Sir, In 2^(n-1) possibilities the possibility of A1 alone is also included right. Which is not a superkey.
wasted previous half an hour on this, finally found this. Thank you
Did&#39;nt understand properly sir
your way of teaching is just amazing , my all concepts are clear now after watching your videos even though i hadn&#39;t  learned or read anything about the same from anywhere except my college lectures that are just formality and wastage of time, thanks for being such a nice teacher.<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>

outstanding sir..
Dear Sir, <br>I am your old student. I have been attending your lectures for almost 2 years. But now there are too many ads, due to which I lose my concentration several times. Please reduce the number of ads.
i think correct ans be 3*(2^n-2).
Sir aap best padate
i am little confuse with all keys
🔥❤️
Sir ur amazing
ty sir

excellent sir!!!
You teach better than my lecturer. Seriously bro
Super key smj nhi aya muje 🥺
Really u r lecture was straight forward, which can give clear picture. I listen soo many DBMS, but they was soo lengthy like jilebi.... No direct defination with example..... I really thankful to u r lecture......
Thanks a lot for such informative tutorial.
Answer shouldn&#39;t be 2^n-1 -1 because there should be 1 more attribute with ck
Maja aagaya 🥺
Nice
Sir if there are three candidate keys how to calculate possibilities of super key
धन्यवाद सर जी
Can you pls  upload a playlist of computer graphics?? This subject is hard but is not actually available on YouTube.
Hats off sir ...
Roll no toh primary key hai how can it be a candidate key?
Best...thank you so much!!💞🤗
thanks u sir your videos helped a lot for my interviews❤❤❤
I wasted my 2 millions in university till master .... !  Here I am saving my future for free .... thanku sir 🙏
I think last answer is wrong . It should be 3×2^n-4.
You should use combinations formulae to solve the questions .It would be more clear .
Sir Today Lecture I can&#39;t learn due to not give short introduction of primary key but you start with candidate key<br>😭😭😭
I have a question.<br>Why we are saying that Roll No. is Candidate Key as well as Super Key at the same time? Any reason.<br>If anyone knows the answer, then please reply.
Ayya ayya super ayya

Sir <br>Can you please share your notes using your notes we can clear doubts easily
I have a doubt that every attribute must be stored atyribute instead derived because except derived value of exah attribute must be stored databse

We can divide student age as yyyy, mm, dd also na. In some cases we calculate the students who born between 2000 and 2004. So we can divide age into three parts and this is also compound attribute na..

Superb

Sir you are born to be a teacher ❤

One of the best teacher...Really salute you and your way of explanation ❤
Sir in relationship table <a href=""http://e.id/"">E.id</a> =5 <br>And <a href=""http://d.id/"">D.id</a> is = 3. so the <a href=""http://d.id/"">D.id</a> remain blank so we choose <a href=""http://e.id/"">E.id</a> as primary key ?? Because primary key never be null <br>Please reply My  comment
best lecture ever.
wow
The way you&#39;re teaching is veryy unique sirr! Understood clearly thanks sir🙏🏼

Very helpful video 😀👌👌👌<br>Thank you sir 🙏

sirra bai
thank you sir
I love you sir  your teaching is like butter...
If primary key cant be null, then for this example, we would have to just make up D4 D5 right? if we assume DID is the primary key. coz it cant be null then.
not only students but faculties and teachers are also studying and revising their concepts from these videos xD
He is teaching like a tuition teacher Not like a college professor... Whatever🙃 we can understand and thats enough...
I think, many to many realtionship mae alag se table banta hai, baki sab mae ussi table mae ek attribute specify krne se ho jata hain!
I learned this 1 to 1 relationship 2016, but the use and concept became clear by watching this video in 2023 :3. Thanks a lot
ONE MISTAKE , you can&#39;t merge them like that unless atleast one has mandatory participation, if not eid can also have NULL and primary key can&#39;t have NULL <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6MH7f3SnsY&amp;t=15m00s"">15:00</a>
There is a small mistake in this video. Relationship mentioned is many to one, not one-to-one. A department can have many employees, but employee can have one department.
jai jambudeep
is it a full course for college students
You found the  skill  that the nature gives u
love y yar sir kya maja agaya or kya samaj aaaYA
Sir I have a doubt what if the above question had total participation instead of partial participation then what would be the min no of tables and how many would be the primary key??
❤

I m watching it at speed of 2x still everything clear

sir work table ki apni id nhi hogi?
You don’t understand how clear and concise your explanation is. Thank you so much sir.
Sir as said in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6MH7f3SnsY&amp;t=15m06s"">15:06</a> DID can be null, but it is the primary key of table Department , so wont that be a problem?
Nice
Department I&#39;d cannot be primary key  in work... as it may be repeat.. e1 may be in d1 and e2 will also from d1
Outstanding explanation!!!!
Nice
Sir, in 1:1 relationship, min no of tables can be 1 also, if  the total participation of both the entities are 1..<br>So, we can merge all three tables.<br>Pl clarify
♥️
ap ne jo nya table bnaya hai merge kr k, us me foreign value repeat nhe hongi na?
Thank you sir

JazakAllah Sir. Thankyou So much for your contribution in teaching. Love from Pakistan❣️
excellent
Sir mere syllabus me three type ki hi relationship di hui h
Great concept.....
Same value ka nahi gheyach
Very nice sir g 🙏😀. 👍👍👍👍
Sir boht kmalll ki teaching krty hain appp ......thnkuuuu
Excellent explanation sir🙏
sir can u give some practice question on every topic or some important specific topic for exam. It will help so much.
u r too awesome sir. After watching ur videos i can easily uderstood all the topics.
Hello sir, <br>Here you&#39;re making Employee id as primary key but this will make the some Employee as a orphan <br>To avoid we need to make Dapartment ID as primary key because it acts as a parent table
This is some serious content that we are getting for free on youtube. God Bless You sir, you don&#39;t know how much you are helping the student community. Thank you for your teaching, thank you so much sir !!!!!!!!!!!!
DID can have repeated values as more than one employee can work in the same department.
@GateSmashers Sir, Thank you for such great lectures these really help us to have a better understanding of the subject,<br><br>I have a question about the concept in the video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6MH7f3SnsY&amp;t=11m50s"">11:50</a>  : how can EID be the primary key in the works table? It is possible for one individual to work in many departments. What will we do in such scenarios? Will there be duplicate rows with unique PK or FK in either table if they are merged?
I am in class 10th and still watching your courses and I am able to understand everything. Thanks a lot for such a great lecture
sir, the example you gave has a slight issue. in the works table, Why should dept_id not be repeated. more than 1 employees cn work in the same dept. this was a little confusing but the conce[t is clear.
If it is one to one, then can department be null ? If yes then shouldn&#39;t this scenario called one to zero ?
Sir you are great
🫶🏻❤️‍🩹

Hello, i have one question. What if one order have more than 1 items ordered by a customer? I do not think it will help the merged table having primary key, order id. I guess the order ids will be repeated after that.<br>Hope you will respond back soon

Bhaiya aap to India&#39;s best GATE coaching ki faculty se bhi zyada acha padha rahe ho😵‍💫😵‍💫. Main 3 month se madeasy ki coaching le rha hu.South Indian faculty bhari padi h. Hindi unhe aati nahi.

Sir, there is no need to request for subscription because you deserve our subscriptions 👍<br>And I know Whoever watches your videos will definitely subscribe your channel 😊
Hey Varan Sir Can you please Cover a session on Apex and Ansible Just a Brief overview
@9.24<br>If there is a customer say C7 who doesn&#39;t place any order, in that case, in the &quot;give&quot; table the Order ID for this c7 will be null. In that case how could Order ID be the primary key for the &quot;give&quot; table if there is a record that is NULL?
The best explanation ever had for the cardinality concepts. Thanks a lot for the detailed informative video.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZxETdO_KUQ&amp;t=9m58s"">9:58</a> is bat se agree nhi karta me.. ye koi logic nhi hua ki many side wali primary key hogi<br><br>ye to ek trh se ratta marne wali bat hogyi
Exam based padhaya h kya ye??
is there any chance to  C1 AND C2 CAN OREDR SAME ITEM ,THENY Y
The only mistake in this video is that he is requested his subscribers to subscribe his channel at the very beginning.😂<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
Apka pasina apki mehnat bta rha h thank you so much sir❤️
thankyou so much sir for this series..i was searching for these topics on youtube for the past one month and today when i saw your videos they are so easy to understand ..you taught us in a very simply way.. and in depth that no other teach ..thankyou once again .
primary key toh relationship table  ki koi bhi ho skti h sir
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZxETdO_KUQ&amp;t=9m45s"">9:45</a> you are saying that one customer gives many orders. Suppose a customer C1 is ordering o1 on XYZ date and he likes it. after some days or months again C1 gives order o1 on ABC date,  order number is now repeated value. So how order id will be uniquelyy identified?
but c2 also get the o_no1 so how it is unique
Is there any 3x speed
Legends watch this video 2x 😆one day before exam
❤❤
interesting lecturE
why c2 can&#39;t give order of bucket? or shoes?  what will be case?
great video
You have mentioned that in the relationship table, Order number will be the primary key because it will be unique. But what if customer 2, 3 also orders buckets, then wont their order number be same
dear sir, im from Pakistan, i studied through your videos for my practical exam in university and i scored 86% marks. thank you so much for providing us such a quality education free of cost &lt;3
I have a question, in this case what if the same order is placed by two different customers, for example if two customers c1 and c2 order same thing order O1 then in that case the order O1 is repeated and hence it can&#39;t be primary key, isn&#39;t it?
Thanks from pakistan
May God bless you

Sir isme agr ek  coustomer biscuit manga sakhta hai toh dusra coustomer kyu nhi manga sakhta ye real life meg toh hota hai??????
Kya padhateho sir AK Number
Nice
Why can&#39;t we make a table with primary key (ID, O_no). <br>So minimum number of tables will be 1.
Life Saving 🥹❤️‍🔥
sir my doubts: but different customer can order same  product(order no.- iterm name ),suppose  4 customer order same product - bucket then  order no. should be 1 i.e. o_no :1  how it should be  a primary key of &quot;give&quot; of ER only unique i.e it should be customer id  . then you have to merge  first and second table i.e. &quot;customer&quot; and &quot;give&quot;. <br><br><br>sir I go your point  primary should be always of multiple  relationship in one to multiple relationship but in given example &quot;customer&quot; and &quot;give&quot; should be merge na ?
Jab C3 ko Bucket O1 order karna ho to order ID bhi to duplicate ho jayega. Order ID ko kese PK define kar sakte he relationship wale table mai. Can you please explain?
😇🤗
sir please clear my doubts. If customer3 order a shirt so Given table Order-on3 we are putting or not . If putting so Given table same value repeated and you also talk the same value there was no required. if you don&#39;t understand my comment you tell me
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Watching one night before exam 🤣🤣
are the 1 to n  and 1 to m are same concept  ?
hats off from 🇵🇰
Thank you so much sir from pakistan ✨
Thank You ...Sooooo Soooooooo much Sir
there could be a chance that customer C2 can buy order no O1 and customer C3 can buy the same order no O1<br>I am totally confused right now ; (
There is no finish line. &gt; Means no race &gt; means enjoy the journey
sir apne ulta toh nhi boldiya
I wish if I had watched this before by interview, I could I have taken 10LPA🥲🥲
C2 same order kar shkte he as a c1

Many many thanks..i am online bca student of one college.. actually i am civil engineer in a govt service. My age is 59 years. But to get some extra knowledge and to use my  retirement spare time for knowing something i had enrolled. But your lecture give too much knowledge for sitting in 2nd semester examination.. thanks sir
Sir C2 bhi to de sakhta hai Order1.... Fir to order bhi repeat hoga...Plz tell.
You are superb... Infect I&#39;m studying from you for my SSC IMD exams computers science subject... I&#39;ll definitely recommend your channel to my frds😊 thanks you so much for sharing your precious knowledge to us on free of cost...
How come order ID become primary key..... As customer 2 can also order the same product as customer 1 and then... Both customer ID and order ID will be repeating and then no primary key will be present .<br>Solution:- only 1 customer ID can be present in customer relation table.
Item number🤣🤣🤣
I wish you&#39;d be my teacher in college. My dbms teacher  is just ruining our future so successfully 😂😂
Thanks a lot sir, respect from Pakistan 💗
sir what if Customer 2 gives the same order as Customer 1 i.e. O1 and O2.....it is possible bcz any 2 customers can give same orders ...it is not necessary that each customer would give different orders always.....then what would be the primary key as order number is also repeating now
Thank u soooo... Much 😄😍
Lecture 19 ka link chahiye plz
Excellent teaching techniques.very very thankful to you.god will always blessings you ♥️
bhaiya there is a possibility that the middle table may have customers that order same item . So the O_No column will have orders O1 , O2,  O3, O4 and same could be repeated . if the values are repeated then how can it be a primary key ?? please answer this doubt bhaiya
i have no words to appreciate ur efforts .The way u teach, the way u explain everything is tremendous .God bless u for this work! .
can we have 2 primary keys in a single table?
Sir you are just awesome teacher ,🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌😘😘

why two customers can&#39;t order same item? <br>So both key(O_no and ID)  can&#39;t act as primary key for give table. Only left is date table. I think primary key become &quot;date&quot;.<br><br>plz, reply.<br><br>i think you example match with many to many relation."

In Course Table, we can also take &quot;name&quot; attribute as Primary Key, as the name of courses cannot be same for two different courses and solve further accordingly,  Am I correct?? 🤔🤔

Relationships are always based on a common field present in both the tables but here in both tables primary key is different so how is it possible to have relationship between both tables based on common field can you please answer this thank you
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onR_sLhbZ4w&amp;t=8m44s"">8:44</a> you are saying that we can make a composite primary key, each row will differ from the others. But what if a student fails the course and again he wants to enroll in that particular course, then the composite key will be repeated. please explain.
I am in love with this concepts and teaching styles, a big thankss sir

Good explanations about the RDBM concepts! one suggestion is that you have to give a chance for the audience to take a screen shot in the beginning , middle and at the end when the white board is fully written up! Keep your right up as you always have conceptual contents and concepts in your videos.
Excellent sir your way of teaching is so precious and your video help me inhanced a typical topic. Most of the YouTuber only give us bird eye views.. Thanks sir... Always live in happiness

How do you know today is Independence day 🫢
Any malyali here like me 😂 👉🏻❤
But many to many relationship mae to teen table bante hai na because many to many  relationship table mae koi primary key ni hoti hain jiski vajah se tables ki merging ni hoti toh 3 table banne chaiye many to many ke liye and 2 tables banenge one to many ke liye which equals to 5???
I wished it was in English,
God of backbenchers 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I think total 4 table
sir e1 table kaise bana kyuki woh toh kisi k sath bhi combine nahi hua
Ver nice class
Sir ji weak entity er diagram ka main topic h wo to nhi krya aapne
Thank you for your awesome teaching.
Can we  form a 4 rth table  with attribute E4 ? If not why ?
Subtitle?
thanks
I just solved it in 1 second bcz Sir I watched your previous videos on e r model relationships.
Thank you so much sir 😊
EK question tha ki agar last vala many to many vala jo apne bola ki 2 table banega vahan teen banna chahiye na kyunki e2 ka table bhi toh combine nhi hga vo toh alag rhega
Watched ur previous videos and I was able to solve this Qs in the first 10 secs. Thanks a lot sir. 😊😊
This is the far most the best channel for Learning DBMS, best teaching ever !!
Watching this vedio to prepare myself for my tommorow&#39;s DBMS exam ! <br>Your teaching skills are so much simple and easy yet Interestingly Awesome 💖💖
isme E2 ka table kyu nhi bnaya ? Many to Many mein to kisi k sath bhi combine nhi hua .. to E2 ka bhi to bnana chahiye tha ?
thank you bhaiya🙏
Sir your lectures are really very helpful, the concepts that looked confusing are very easier to understand after listening to you. The way of you teach is so Amazing that I&#39;ll be short of words. THANKYOUU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE HELP!😄
Happy Independence day bhakton ps:-MODI BHAKT
Thank you very much Sir for this video.
When we have E-r Model(E1R2E2) the 3 number of tables are created ,<br>T1=E1; T2=R1E2; T3=R2; T4=E2<br>So the minimum no of tables are create I.e 4
same to you
Sir isme Mai 2 table bnega soch rha th kyoki  R1B ,R2 ko hum bnayenge but A table pahle see given hai to use count Ni krenge krke
Great content sir, I was able to answer the question perfectly, while understanding the meaning behind it. Many thanks.
After 2 years it is still helpful sir ❤️
Nothing to say about you sir <br>Your teaching technique is ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Jo jo ans soch ki video ki last me gaya vo like kare🤣
These questions are so simple.<br>You should have taken little more complex example.
sir, minimized no. of table should be 5 na if we see one to many and many to many separately.?
Hi Sir this is Sheikh Raza from Pak and I&#39;m confused about the answer you&#39;re telling is correct.<br>Actually in First relationship 1 table for E1 <br>, 1 for E2 and 1 for R1 so it means total 3 from 1st relationship which we can reduce to 2 tables because of 1-M relationship and in relationship 2 there&#39;s 3 tables 1 for each E1,E2 and R2 so in total minimum Numbers of tables from both relations will be 2+3=5.<br>I understand your point of view but<br>Kindly give me your Valuable response for my point of view.<br>Thanks
sir koi book b to suggest kro questions solve krne k liye
Thankyouu sir😇
in M-N many to many we are suppose to form 3 tables na?
Thank you very much. Your videos are helping a-lot in understanding of Database Subject. I am doing my Masters from University of North Texas.

Sir many to many wale video main aapne bola tha ki relation ship table ko course wale k sath nhi combine kr skte (aur ye bhi kha tha ki kisi k sath combine nhi kr skte)<br><br><br>Prr isme aapne relationship table ko E2 se combine kr diya..... Ye kuch smajh nhi aaya<br><br><br>Please example k sath smajhna dijiye

sir in many to many relationship here,  as the tables can&#39;t be merged so there will be individual table for E1, E2 and R2  then the total number of tables will be 5 or we have to consider only R2 table as the final table, please explain i&#39;m little confused
👍👍
Sir, I think the answer would be 5.<br>Because in 1-M relationship we have a minimum of &quot;2&quot; table &amp;<br>In M-N relationship we have required a minimum of &quot;3&quot; table <br>3+2= 5.<br>😥 I couldn&#39;t get it sir pls help me out 🙏🏾sir .
Thank you sir ❣️
Sir, What about E2 separate table in M-N  ralationship ??
Sir have u covered topics for  Total participation,  strong and weak entity set..unable to find..pls guide
Thankyou sir for such a lovely course and beautiful explanation🤗❤
Very intuitive teaching. Thanks for these videos.
watching this video On 15 Aug. Aapko bhi swatantrata Diwas Ki Hardik Shubkamnaye sir :)
thanks alot!
Thank you sir for these videos
👍👍👍
In this how the table no is 3? Because in first relation we are getting two tables i.e. E1 &amp; (R1E2) &amp; in second relation we are getting three tables E1,E2 &amp; R2. In this as E1 is repeating we can count this as 1 but still the total no. of tables are 4. Can anyone please tell me where i am making mistake?
Sir ye lectures enough han full DBMS course k liye?Ya sirf apnaay ye GATE ki preparation k liye krwaye hn?
very good example for practice relationship model in dbms😍
Ur do table many to many k count kie <br>Mtlb jab third table join nh hwa to koi reduce b nh hwa to wo three table thy .<br>Ye point please mje clear kra den
Sir please guide me <br>One to many me total three table bny thy, phr jab reduce hwe to do table reh jaty haina. Lekin ap to yahan one to many ka ik table count ker rahy hain. Please guide me
Sir my doubt is jub hum m to n me merge hi kar sakte to three tables to m to n ke aur two tables one to many ke hona tha to total 5 tablet hote kya ??
Hello Sir, Pls tell me some projects Which can be built only using SQL??

Sir isme many to many main table tino bnegi mean E1 k liy to phle se h fr E2 ki Jo one to many m nhi h but many to many m to bnani pdegi na to no of table 4 honi chiye
Sir when we are considering M-N relationship why are we not considering separate table for E2? Is it because it is already taken into account during 1-M relationship? Please help me understand.  Thanks 😊"

I was relayed on your videos as usual but tomorrow is my exam and I couldn’t find topic of query optimisation and tree query in relational algebra
UPDATE STUDENT SET Sname= &#39;Amrit Pal&#39; where Sid=4; instead of sid = 2.   :)
❤
Sir please don&#39;t use english if you not good is english
Is there anyone available answer plz.<br> What if there is no SId column in table then how can we apply primary key bon Sname and SAge it&#39;s not possible then after it kya krna chiyeh row level mai?
sir! ap row ko column or column ko row bol rahy hy

Query to sikhaya hi nahi bindass use kar rhae ho ye bOl ke ki jaisa ki humko pata hai <br>Pata hai par acche se nahi pata
Very helpful video sir thank you
but we can identify the salary of particular teacher by giving primary key in update command like;- Update  table_name   set   salary =40000 where sid=3;
Sir how this table has sane value of column?
I am data engineer with 4 years of exp and I do DML everyday but I was unaware of most of the concepts. Thank you for the quality and pellucid content. moreover,  it will be helpful if you enable donation option, I believe, many students, professionals would like to donate you.
Use 1.25*speed
INDUS wale sare attendance lagav
Sir in updation anamoly if we give a primary key in where condition then only that particular faculties salary will be change . isn&#39;t it?  <br>like {update salary of F1 from 30000 to 40000 where Sid =1 }
Rollback se waps la skte h naa?
Wo to row h
Second wala coloum kaise ho gya
After 5 years i watch this video and  i found same person always energetic 🙇‍♂️🙏
Best video thank you so much sir
Really good 💯
One question, in last example you separate the table as student, course and teacher but how they are then connected to each other, how can I know that which teacher is teaching which course to which student?
my goodness what a video. spent 10 minutes rewatching the anomalies coz i had so many doubts. everything ended at the end.
what happend  bro you are looking sad in this video
Sir, just a doubt.... How can you say Deletion Anomaly is an anomaly??? I mean if you have parsed a query asking it to delete a record based on a condition, it will definitely delete all of it...
hein?? where krke jb condition dala ki change salary where sid=2 toh sirf ussi ke liy change krega na baaki se usko kya lena dena......
Thank you sir
TBH i not at all understood the insertion and deletion anomalys....i mean i didn&#39;t find any problem in inserting and deleting the rows or students
5 years down the line updating to &#39;amrit pal&#39; doesn&#39;t seem to be a good idea
Sir I don&#39;t have words to describe how the best teaching experience you have ,great one sir ❤️❤️❤️
You are the best teacher..... 👌👌

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GDTIUVlHB8&amp;t=4m59s"">4:59</a> what is the problem here, why cant we insert the data
SIR BUT SID OF AMRIRTPAL IS 4 HOW U WRITE  2 I CANT UNDERSTAND
Sir I have a dout ...<br>Always the I&#39;d is unique for every faculty members then why we are taking F1 same for  all???
thanks a lot for giving the reason why normalization is required.

sir bs thora ap ny ye confuse kr dia k ap rows ko column or column ko row bol ry thy
FID jab change kar rhe h to har jagh change hona chahiye na kyuki....wo to teacher ek hi h fid1 to uska jitne jagh naam hoga har jagh salary update hogi na??
You are my online teacher😍
ya pe update keliye sid = 2 bola hai to ..2 ka record nhi hai our sid 4 pr kise update hoga?
Thankyou  so much Sir🙏
Sir when we delete sid = 2 delete all row of sid 2 than we update sid 2 then your name amirtpal amirtpal of sid is 4 than why we update sid 2 than cange name is amirtpal where the sid is 4

My university teacher, sends his video links in the group so that the students can study from his videos. The teacher herself doesn&#39;t take class...
Best cs teacher
Amrit pal 🤣 lomda
Amritpal pols aa  gayi😅😅
Super and cool explanation 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Sir last explanation of updation went WRONG 😂 I think if the salary of F1 is updated in every row required isnt anomaly because F1 is unique I&#39;d. U should have given another example such as we have two JOHN with different F_ID and Update Student Set salary=40000 where F_name=John would cause anomaly as it will change salary of each John irrespective of F_ID but we require to change salary of apna John😅"

I am also from that University where faculty is teaching from this YouTube channel and phir bhi mein yha se dekhi rhi hu😊
In referencing table if there is a course in which only one student is enrolled then deleting the student&#39;s record will also delete that course. So, my question is won&#39;t it create a problem?
great sir thank you so much
Sir aap kitne intelligent ho apko to bahot sare course aate h 👏🙌🙌 respect for you
But sir tabel no 2 mai roll number value ki redendancy ho rhi hai.
Amazingly explained ! Thanks
sir aapke channel pe upload sare playlist sufficient hai gate ke liye. please reply soon.
Guys I think 1st method good right? You are having all details in one table, only drawback is that it might be too clustered with many columns (attributes) in real situation, making harder to work with it. So I guess 3rd is the best option, just that we need add same field (Roll No. here) again in second table which actually is redundancy if both table have it.
Your educational videos are a breath of fresh air on YouTube. You have a great talent for breaking down complex topics into digestible pieces. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us! <br>Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰❤

but why it&#39;s not advisable to have multi-valued attributes?
Thnkiu so much sir 😊 🧿 you r the best teacher
here is a fairly nice explanation of first normal form <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eo5s7fYbng"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eo5s7fYbng</a>
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlgZy30Dv9A&amp;t=3m28s"">3:28</a> :- Sir but you told in one of your previous video that there cannot be a primary which contain more than one attribute or two columns cannot be made primary key so why now we are able to do this???<br><br><br>plz answer if anyone understood!!!
Sir awsome way
Sir normalization is reduce redundancy then how we can explain in interview  because1NF create the duplicate data??
Sir exam me 3no type likhe aana h?
Far better than our department Hod🤣
Nice

so a table cannot be in normal form if I used array as data type, (as provided by some databases )?
the person who is handling camera is madarchod but your explanation is good sir.
Sir koi ek table bnaya to chlega n??
Very very best teacher of our Asia.😍😍😍😍
Primary key hai kya nhi smaja
If someone find this series confusing I will Strongly recommend Jenny&#39;s Lecture cs IT, in this channel i found videos are very organized manner
videos are not in series, <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
You are great sir. You know In very easy way to explain any tough to tough topic. Insallah you will grow onece a day. God bless you...
good
Is it actually attribute being composite or multivalued?
You are a God for every engineering student 💞💕❤❤❤❤
GREAT explanation 🙏🏻
Thank u sir
rollno is  foreign key in the referencing table  ,but what about the course it  also taking the reference from the course table then there must be two foreign key in the referencing table?
Amazing explanation! Thank you so much.
Could you please translate the video language to Arabic 😊
Even I am not good at hindi, I still perfectly understand your explanation. Thank You!
Thank you so much sir
Very helpful video
Bro! you have a nice way of teaching and you teach very well but there is no concept of composite primary key in 1nf 😅
Mr varun sir please make a vedio on DS ,thank you help me alot sir through your dbms vedio
Sir Jo camera operator hai usko jutte mar kr bhagaw. Aap khud set krlo jese pehle ke videos me krte the
It seems you are unknowingly explaining 2N form . Relation comes after 1NF.please don&#39;t confuse people by teaching extra part which are not required.
Amazing teacher ap bohat achay sey clear kartay concepts me sari apne tyari papers ki apki videos sy krti...respect from Pakistan and kahna paray ga you are soooooo talented
No one can be a engineer without your videos 😅
i need this much clarity, and i got....seriously sir deserves my university fee...bevause they&#39;re not worth to teach me further deep, but sir does.....well, its the most important question of aktu University dbms mca exam an he saved my marks...😇 satisfied as i always been after watching gate smasher s videos....
The fact that i feel relieved when i see your video when i look for a concept on youtube just explains how good you;re at teaching complicated stuff.
in 2nd representation it shows null for reema&#39;s course but 1nf cant have null.
Sir... When we convert our table in first normal form then our data like id name we write two times.  So we can say that it is also a drawback
Thnq so much ❤️
Ur videos are very clear ...pls explain in English ... Small suggestion from my side
To all the new watchers...<br>I have observed that the way 1st Normal Form reduces redundancy in data as follows:<br>If you stored each Course as a new Row in the same table as described in 1st solution -  what happens here is just to include one more course value, the whole of the student&#39;s other details(name, roll_no, etc.) all have to repeated. Also, in this approach we cannot choose roll_no of a student to be the primary key.<br>So, what we do is use the 3rd solution and stored courses and roll_nos of students in a separate table. This way, the repetition is only of roll_no.s to include each course, and hence redundancy of data is made minimum. We make this a referencing relation to the main relation by having the roll_no attribute map to the main relation&#39;s roll_no attribute as a Foreign Key constraint.
Many many thanks 😊 🙏🏻
❤️❤️❤️
Thank you Sir..
notes :<br>1 nf : if it does not contain any composite or multi-valued attribute then relation is 1nf.
good explanation
Great great content..really liked it❤❤
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlgZy30Dv9A&amp;t=3m33s"">3:33</a> tw phr Name bhi tw primary key bn skti h na ?
Best course for dbms
AOA sir I am from Pakistan.<br>Sir kindly teach that what is the exact meaning of DBMS PLZ<br>WELL <br>U ARE TEACHING GOOD <br>KEEP IT UP <br>REGARDS: KALEEM ULLAH
You might live on this earth 100 years but your work will remain forever...<br>😇🥰<br>Actually you will live forever..
Sir aassalam alikum Sir me ny ap sy pochna tha 1st normal form me humy ye 3no table bna ny pary gy kia or Sir apka teaching ka method bht Acha  bht Acha smja ty h
Love ur style nd simplicity varun
Sir , you are telugian ???
Thank you sir
Thank you so much🙏🏻 it really easy to understand
Why did you consider course as a primary key in the reference table?  thanks btw for the explanation.
Very nice explanation sir

I think ce is also a candidate key bcz. BC -&gt;D so C-&gt;D and D-&gt; A and A-&gt; B and C-&gt; so CE is also a candidate key

I think CE+ can also determine as a candidate key..at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=16m00s"">16:00</a> (C-&gt; D, D-&gt;A, A-&gt;B, C-&gt; is self, E is self ) ABCDE
Sir u r amazing....my Fonda is now cleared ❤❤😅
Great explanation ✨🙂
Itna achhe koi kaise padha sakta hai i mean how
saviour ,as always!!!
Our College Sir learns from here, literally the same example he repeats.
what do you mean by candidate key is always minimal?
Sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=15m38s"">15:38</a> you cant derive D from B because it violates the Decomposition property of Functional Dependency you taught in your lecture number 23.
In the first example only AIs candidate,but in the second example same dependencies and one extra attribute..we got all as candidates.then y this not the case with first example?
Sir, thank you for all that you do. I have a question. For D, it is preceded by BC; can we have BCE to to determine with attributes?
sir you said that AB is super key in first example and than in last example you wrote that AE ,BC,CE,DE as candidate key i did&#39;t understand those part sir, please explain it
some one give him mic
use mic you are resounding
Thank you bhaiya 🙏
I didn&#39;t know the difference between candidate and super key but now it is crystal clear.
lecture se jada to ad henge bc
Sir example 3 mai CE+ ke attributes hai and it can be the candidate key BC-&gt;D so C-&gt;D and D-&gt; A ,A-&gt; B
sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=12m28s"">12:28</a> in example 3 you said AE would be a candidate key but then in example 1 you said that there AB could not be a candidate key because candidate key is minimal then in eg 3 how did A become a candidate key . Please clear this doubt
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=15m06s"">15:06</a> The FD is BC--&gt;D, which means you need B and C to get D. But you have splitted the FD as B--&gt;D and C--&gt;D which is wrong.<br>The splitting property doesn&#39;t work like that, eg: if A--&gt;BC then you can split it to A--&gt;B and A--&gt;C, not like the way you did.
I think there is (8.17)no any prime attribute in this relation because prime attributes are the &quot;&quot;PART OF CANDIDATE KEY&quot;&quot; not it self.<br>  It is little bit confuse...
Yeh kya bawasir topic hai😵‍💫!
in third question AE,BE and DE are composite keys right?
Why CE is not a Candidate key........Its closure have all attribute of relation
CE will also be candidate key if we find its closure in the same way as we did of AE.
Jab AE candidate key ho sakta hai then uske pahle aapne example diya tha and bola ki AB candidate key nahi ho sakta wo super key hoga to AE super key nahi hoga kya?
Hello sir, i am following this series from scratch and past 2 3 videos including this , idk why looks strange and not able  to catch it.
sir  AB is not candidate key and  it prime key but here we are saying BE  is candidate key
Sir you are so great 👍🏻
No words sir thank you so much❤️
deserve billion subsribers
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=12m35s"">12:35</a> is AE candidate key or super key??? You said combined is always a super ley, it&#39;s not candidate key, can anyone please confirm 🙏
in question 3, is (BCE) a candidate key?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=15m28s"">15:28</a> BC -&gt;D both BC are determining D so you can&#39;t divide them and write B-&gt;D &amp; C-&gt;D. You yourself explained it in Functional Dependency video.
Hi a MAKAUT student on this side, <br>Is the last example correct or my Makaut organizer gives a wrong answer in book<br><br>The answer in the book is this when the relation has one nore attribute i.e &#39;H&#39; -<br><br>Find out the candidate Keys for the following relation R: R (A,B,C,D,E,H), F (A-&gt;B, BC-&gt;D, E-&gt;C, D-&gt;A)<br>. <br>Answer:<br>(H)+→ H<br>(HA)+→ HAB........... as, A→B <br>(HAE)+→ HAEBCD.....as, BC-&gt;D, E-&gt;C, D-&gt;A<br>(HD)+→  HDAB... as, A-&gt;B, D→A<br>(HDE)+→ HDEABC. as, BC-D&gt;, E-&gt;C,<br>(HE)+→ HEC........... as, E-&gt;C<br>(HEB)+ →HEBCDA...as, BC-&gt;D, D-&gt;A <br>Thus, {H, D, E}, {H, A, E}, {H, E, B} composite candidate keys.
In last question answer  what is the prime attribute?
Honestly God created a man for us!
for third question, why did you stop at using 2 attributes. why can we start searching for CEA=CEABD, for example since CE alone is not a candidate key. also CEB=CEBDA, CED=CEDAB. with this we have 3 new candidate keys
Superb sir Thankyou 🙏
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=5m33s"">5:33</a>  :- A candidate kay can only be minimal like; CK = {A}<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=16m30s"">16:30</a>  :- So why we consider these keys CK as the are not minimal like; CK = {AE,DE,BE} ?????????????🤔🤨<br><br><br>Can anyone explain!!!!😥😥
I have doubt<br> if AB is super key than why BE and CE are candidate key they should be super key as well
Change board color
why u took closure of E? what purpose doe it serve?
what if every attribute is present on the RHS of the FD? what then, please cover all corner cases and don&#39;t leave things to interpretations
if candidate key is always minimal then why in the 3rd example E is combining with all
Dimagh ki maa behen hogai 😂
Nice
In first example you said combination of two attributes cannot be a candidate key then how we can solve question 3 by combining two attributes??
Sir is lecture main voice sahi nhi ap k
I have a confusion in Example:3,<br><br>Candidate key is minimal and cannot be combined with other attributes.<br><br>Then why in Example 3, CK: AE? CK: DE, and CK: BE?<br><br>Aren’t these super keys? Please help clearing my confusion anyone
sir how AE is a candidate isnt it a super key?
Sir can you post some python videos.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=13m19s"">13:19</a> wow thank you🙏🏻
thank you sir
I was finding it so difficult!! But you made it too easy for me😊
sir 3 wale example me BCE , ADE  bhi to candidate key he
Sir I have doubt this topic will ask in interview or not?plz tell me sir
One of the best teacher I have ever seen ....
Sir  , you are a God level teacher. Thank you for saving my dbms paper. 🙂
Where BC -&gt; D<br>So at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=15m19s"">15:19</a> how is he writing only B at D place, and also only C at D place.<br>As he is teaching in next class that if BC combination determines D then B or C alone cannot determine D.
Sir sound quality bhut low h
sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=14m49s"">14:49</a> why BE can&#39;t be candidate key as it is deriving all attributes of relation??
respect++
why cannot alone E can be candidate key in example 3 , rest all I understood?
Sir ji mujhe nhi lagta aapka kabhi gate qualify hua hoga kyunki agha adhura aap pdha rhe ho jitna aapko aata hai sirf utna pdha rhe ho functional dependency normalization triggers cursors kuch nhi padha rakha maine apna time waste kar liya aapke 21 videos dekh kar sabse ghatiya youtube channel hai ye<br>Edit: normalization sir 3nf tak padha rakha hai <br>or functional dependency bht todhi si <br>sir time waste mat karo bachho ka
ebc will be a candidate key as well <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvM_0hzgc&amp;t=17m06s"">17:06</a>
It is highly reccommended to watch lecture 23 video before this one, the concept will be much more clear.
i am confused now with candidate key and super key. u said anything with any candidate-key will make super key and at last you are again checking for candidate key.
Sir right now mei 22nd video dekh ri hu out of 130..soon 130 jaldi punchungi
CE bhi atta hai na Candidate key<br>c-&gt; D, D-&gt; A, A-&gt;B <br>So CE+=(CEDAB)==ck
example 3 was confusing.
CHANDIGARH UNIVERSITY STUDENTS  , SHOW YOUR PRESENCE 👍👍
what does determine means here , in that video
But sir in 1 table only one prime attribute.... Then how A, B, C, D
Thank you for explaining this concept so perfectly! This video really helped me.
Ab koi raat ko neend se utha kar ke candidate key nikal ne ko bole to bhi nikal saktu hu.<br>Aag laga di <br>🔥🔥🔥
BCE+ =EBCDA can also be a candidate  key
CK={AE,BE,DE,BCE} I guess
Thank you very much you&#39;re way of teaching is good but today your sound is coming not good
Thank you 😊 so much sir to explain everything without any confusion.
Sir CE bhi candidate key ho sakti hai because C-&gt;D hai and after all we can solve.
amazing teaching and easy explain.<br>very good brother keep it up.
Camera pr se in ko hta do bhaiya, disturbing hai ye.
Uhh aree simplyyyy amazing..... <br>No wrds to discribe....<br>Cmplt pack of knowledge....<br>Bestestt teacher ever.........<br>So soooooo thankful sir....
I had a doubt how can AE be a C.K. , you mentioned earlier that C.K. should be simple not composite, please answer and thanks for the effort of making these videos
we undertands that this is determining this or that but whta the hell that means
in this video apne ye ni smjaya ki what is the menaing of determines
bhai ji pehle gfunctional dependicies to samja dete
i have a small doubt here if someone can clear <br>i think CE will also be candidate key since CEDAB (pls check in this order and let me know)
Sir can you please rearrange your playlist topic wise like the topics here are up and down and some time it takes time to find the topic connecting to it like it normalisation some dependency topic are above some are below as that topic should have to be started from dependency that all the problem is. All the contents are good and easy to understand
Great lectures 🌺🌺
thanks gate smasher
Why ab is super key then in eg 1 as a is not in right hand side so taking b with a should form a candidate key as in eg 3 where e is taken with a to form ck!
can someone please explain example(3) to me? it went over my head even though i tried watching it back a couple of times :(
Thank you so much sir. But {} is empty set and phi means empty set. {phi} means phi is an element in the set. so  Prime Attribute is either {} or phi not {phi}.
Sir apne kha ki in first example me ki candate key minimal hota hai AB+ canditate key nhi hoga ,super key hoga.lekin last example me AE,BE kaise hoga? Canditate key to minimal hota hai na ye to super key hoga
bro what is funtional dependecy??<br>ye wala vdo achank se lec 22 me aa gya....<br>21 me noemal form 1 padhaya apne lekin lec 22 me achanakk se funtional dependency..<br>smjh me nhi aa rha

i love u bhaiya aap nhi hote toh me fail hojata exam m ♥
I thought I have a hear loss of right ear 👂
can a non prime attribute determine prime attribute in 3NF?
My left ear liked this video
abe kya padaya hai bsdk

Sir ye kam to primary key bhi karata hai na?
Hello Sir! Not only this playlist but your playlist of OS and computer organization has also helped a lot understanding the subjects especially during exams. Thank you sooo much for all your hard work and help❤

Audio ko kya ho gaya
Thanku so much varun bhaiya 😊😊<br>Mujhe plz ek baar decomposition bta di jiye plz
aap hi sahara ho hum students ka.......
Thank you for your hard work sir
Truly the best DBMS teacher. I study in NITW but although the professors here are great,  I still learnt everything from gate smashers.
If t1.x=t2.x then t1.y=t2.y is it Functional Dependency !?
thank you
Sir agr ap online classes dty hyn to kindly add me and show me your contact here plz..i will be thankful to you..
Sir i have a poor programming ..kindly can u teach me online if you can it will be your kindness..😥

sahi hai Boss.....🙌
As we all here to learn DBMS, we all know how to sync the audio （づ￣3￣）づ╭❤～
Primary key should have unique values .. but in this customer I&#39;d and store I&#39;d is repeating.. kinda confusing..pls explain
waah re
After watching this video i am clear of 2NF .. Proper video for understanding 2NF.. Thanks
Sir ,their is a delay in this video 🙄
What is candidate key
so inshort we can say no that &quot;no prime attribute should determine any non-prime attribute&quot;...... as ac to u it is that no part of candidate key should determine non-prime attribute and every part of candidate key is called as prime attribute , so no prime attribute should determine non-prime attribute <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>

Aapke video ka sabse bara drawback ye hai ki aap ek hi language ka use karo,thora bahot mix chalega..but aapko jaha pe Hindi mei samjhana hota hai oha pe aap jyada hi English mei samjhane lagte hai..jaise maano aap khud hi samjh rehe ho...kyuki more than 80% people who likes hindi...bhale hi o English ko mix kare
Great Explanation bro
Sir mic issue ek airpod mn awaaz arhi doosre mn nahi aarhi kindly acha mic lelen

Sir , Your words go directly in the permanent brain memory.❤

Sir,vedio ka sequence thik nehi hai...1 NF ke bad closure attributes hai...
Aap yaha candidate key bol rahe ho....pure notes dekhliye mene usme bus primary key mentioned hai
Thankyou sir your video is very helpful my exam. Your are best teacher for dbms👍👍👍👍
AS A IS DEPENDENT ON E AND B IS DEPENDENT ON A THEN B IS DEPENDENT ON <a href=""http://e.so/"">E.So</a> I think this is a partial dependencicy

the video became bad due to difference in voice <br>Sir plz improve it , other videos were amazing , this one wasn&#39;t
Guruji Hindi mei samjha dete 😅
Seriously mere paas hone ki wajah aap ho aaap !💕
Always not clearing
How candidatekey will be that customer id and store id
no sound
thanks sir
Maybe my earphone is damege😅
Audio is not good it is very slow voice  so, fix it. 👍
MAshaAllah Bro! Got the things clear after this one ! <br>May Allah bless you!
Sir Hindi me smjao n
L vid, sorry. :(
Sir why we didn&#39;t take 3 proper subset to create candidate key in your prev video there is one key which is not present right side that is E so you took AE,BE etc why we didn&#39;t take here with EC like AEC,BEC etc?
awsome content as always sir <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>❤
Rip right earphone 😂
Will u marry me❤
this dude&#39;s F looks like an E. also sometimes E looks like epsilon.
sir plz provide audio for that
i understood this video very well thank you for that
bro atleast fix this..cannot understand the topic
Now i know all features of my earpods😅
2 NF Mein 2nd earphone kharab😅🎧
sir hindi m hi pdhaya kro ap english m smjh nhi aati apse padhai
This vedio contains bad knowledge
good video
2 min silence for those who didnt observed this lag
Bro.. can u please explain these all normal forms with a single example
the best part is that if u have been through his playlist then this lecture may be understood without audio :⁠-⁠)
Good job sir❤,keep it up
No Sound
Thank you Sir for such quality videos that are short and easy to understand. Much respect!
Everything Is Good But Plzz Use sometimes Hindi Language to Explain Hindi Medium Students ❤
Ap itna sb learn kaise rakh lete h
Sir give information about the parallel database and distributed data base
Suppose we have a table named &quot;Orders&quot; with columns OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, ProductID, and ProductName. Here, the composite primary key would consist of the columns OrderID and CustomerID. To satisfy 2NF, we would need to ensure that the columns OrderDate, ProductID, and ProductName are each dependent on both OrderID and CustomerID.
17 minutes useless lecture.
Nice

Sir I have a question in second example that you said (D) is not a prime attribute ? But you have written prime attribute are (A,B,&amp;D) ?
no words to describe your intelligence and way of representation! i got a back and wish i will clear it
Best teacher 👍 👍👍<br><br>from jammu and kashmir
Sir a Big doubt as there is a contradiction in your method; <br><br>Consider R(A,B,C,D) and AB-&gt;CD and D-&gt;A are given functional dependencies.<br>Here, C.Key = {AB and DB}  therefore Prime attributes = {A,B,D} and Non Prime attributes = {C} ; <br>in D-&gt;A ; Prime attribute(D) determining Prime attribute(A) || No Transitive Dependency <br>But by other rule, LHS is C.Key == False OR RHS is prime attribute==True || Overall TRUE, Tranitive Dependency Exits....<br><br>Which step to follow??? Please Help
aap ko bahot bahot dhyabadh , mujhe normal forms nahi samajh aaraha tha aap ke video ne clear kar diya , me nepal se hu aapko bahut sara dhyawadh
u r the BEST..Appreciate
no 1nf  no 3nf
i just want to say that when u are making examples then u should explain through example only not through this set theory. U should make clear understanding from that table not that set theory.fuck yrr mine head ache grows more because of this shit
Good job 👍👍

What if R(A,B,C,D)<br>FD: AB-&gt;C,D ; C-&gt;D<br>CK: AB<br>Is it 3rd NF?
sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=6m43s"">6:43</a> you said that prime attribute determing non-prime attribute is okay..... but that affects the 2NF condition as the non-prime attributess should be fully functionally dependent on the candidate key and not on its proper subsets. Please clarify!
This whole thing is senseless
Do we always check the table from left to right? If I wrote table columns as State, Roll no, City then, why would I look at State I would directly go to Roll no. as it has all unique values so, for me Roll no. is directly determining all non prime attributes. How would I know that there is transitive dependency?
Neso Academy teaches like best teacher<br>Gate Smashers teaches like best friend<br>Love From Bangladesh🖤
This vedio never gets old.. The explanation was lit🗿💥
May Allah bless you Sir...your student from pakistan 🇵🇰
the last example ...... FD(AB-&gt;CD, D-&gt;A) is it in 2NF? can you explain this
To good channel 🎉
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=6m43s"">6:43</a> a non prime is detemined by prime. Should not it be a partial dependency unless that prime attribute  is a Ck. That mean it is not in 2 nf. Therefore not in 3nf.correct me if wrong. I said it because you said there is only one case where non prime determine non prime.
Sir... It&#39;s an humble request to u plz continue the explanation in English so telugu students and other lsouth states can understand easily.... 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Thnx sir

I don&#39;t know how to thank you enough Sir. I have watched a lot of videos on this topic over YouTube, tried my level best to understand from them but I couldn&#39;t. I am not demeaning them, they are great teachers but I was finding it very difficult to understand their explanation.I must say that the way you teach us is commendable.
If there is a prime attribute in L.H.S and a non-prime attribute in R.H.S, then is it valid to be in 3NF ??<br>In your example, if one F.D is like &quot;D determines C&quot; ??
12th May 2023, two nights before an exam!<br>Let&#39;s see how it goes!🥲🥲
If LHS is Prime Attribute then also, FD is not TD right? Why only LHS has to be Candidate Key or Super Key? Does Super Key indirectly mean Prime Attributes as well?
Simple Method to Explain 3rd Normal form
I m from pakistan or mjy bot mushkil horai thi ....sir u r superb....kmal hogyaa
how can roll number determine state in the first example ?same roll numbers can correspond to two different states.
great

Bhai aap Iss video mai toh 2NF ka pura base he hila diye …. Pata nahi bolna kya chahete hai <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=6m31s"">6:31</a> pe
Roll no state ko determine nhi kr rha h bcoz 1 roll no pr Punjab h nd 3 roll no pr bi Punjab h
can a non prime attribute determine prime attribute in 3NF?
As per the 2NF, the prime attribute at the LHS i.e., a part of candidate key would mean the partial dependency. So, at the LHS if there is a PRIME attribute will it be fine. I am feeling confused on this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=06m09s"">06:09</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=06m12s"">06:12</a>....
Sir let there be a scenario where R(X,Y,Z) and Fds be X-&gt;Y,Y-&gt;Z,Z-&gt;X as we observe X,Y,Z all are candidate keys and as they are on lhs it satisfies bcnf. But my question is that sir but still there exsists transitive depency right so it should not be in bcnf know sir
lil bit confused on the way you found out candidate key on ex.2... like previously, missing on the right side is B, so i think we should keep only B on left and remaining ACD on the right and then start looking closure of B
RESPECT.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=13m32s"">13:32</a> Sir says relation is 3NF cuz no non-prime attr determines a non-prime attr (which is true), but isn&#39;t it the case for 3NF that it must also be 2NF?<br>if you see, we have two CKs = {AB, BD}. However in case of BD, we have A being determined by just a proper subset of BD (B -&gt; A), which violates 2NF constraints. So this isn&#39;t 2NF, so this mustn&#39;t be 3NF?

Roll Number determines city and city determines State. not state determines city.
sir 3rd norml form pura tha ki extra pdha diya ?????
thanks sir for these wonderful videos.
Done
In last question table is not in 2nf . So How it can be in 3nf    ????plz answer me
Amazing ❤️ Explanation with accurate example
what if rollno and state together is a candidate key and FD contains rollno --&gt; city will it be in 3nf as is has do not have transitive dependency?
Bro plz change your camera man , he don&#39;t know where need to focus or where not...
2 hours to go for my paper. Love from Pakistan❤

Bhaiya aapne <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=6m44s"">6:44</a> mein bola hai ki prime_attribute ---&gt; non_prime_attribute. Aisa hone par toh wo 2NF rahega hi nahi because every NPA must be fully functional dependant on the candidate key.
Seriously you are amazing teacher ✨✌️I cleared my all dought from your videos........ thanks 😊
If a table is not in 3rd NF then how to get that in 3rd NF, not explained!?
if {roll no, state}  is a candidate key, it can determine City. City can be defined by state alone and can be partially dependent on state right...so how is it in 2NF to be 3NF
Example 1 violates 2NF rule then , Why we checked for 3NF ?
how peacefully explained ☺️i got all my doubts cleared.
Very nice video
AFTER WATCHING  SO MANY LECTURE NOW MY CONCEPT IS CLEAR 😀
so ye table ka representation kaise rahega 3rd normal form mein please batyee
Sir, you have great teaching skills Thank you so much, Sir
you didnt tell how to split the table
sir , you are like a god for us and my professor is a devil
Sir, pura future barbaad kar diya jholachaap college faculties ne...I wish ki aap jaise teacher har college me ho....You are EPIC..
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=12m53s"">12:53</a>
If the L.H.S can have super key, doesn&#39;t that mean there exists partial dependency? If so, then how can the table be in 3NF if it cant even be in 2NF?<br>Am i missing something?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=12m00s"">12:00</a>
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeSai2JVm78&amp;t=9m54s"">9:54</a> you say DB can also be a candidate key, but it seems to not confirm to 2NF then, given that A can be determined by partial key i.e. D. So possible CKs should be {AB, DBA}
i think RHS should be non prime attributes
well done sir understandable lecture
You incluse DB as ck than why is that not candidate key while checking in FD later.?
You are teaching superrr...sir but in the given example you explained it is not in 2nf sir..am I correct ?
What about solution for 2nd normal form???
Thanks sir 🙏🏻
I am IT officer aspirant and mera selection hoga ya ni pata ni but muje subject seekhne me maza aa ri hai becoz of Sir.<br>Very Easy way apne sabkuch explain kr diya.
Sir am not getting that for a table to be in 3NF there should be no transitive dependency, and the condition you mentioned for transitive dependency is fulfilled so this should not be a 3NF table na as you did for 2NF when there was partial dependency we came to a conclusion that this table is not in 2NF. Kindly clarify it  please.
sir agar Two prime attributes ak dosaray ko determine kar rahay hon. tab koi problem ati hy? jasay roll no or phone number ak dosaray ko determine kar rahay hon.
In 3NF, we hav to determine the weather the given condition satisfy upto 2NF or not... Bt in the last example the candidate keys are  (AB, BD) where  alone D--&gt; A i.e partial dependency exist here... If the given Fd is not in 2NF then how it satisfy the condition for 3NF.? please reply. 🙏
Thank you sir

Is candidate key also given in bcnf? Or how we should find it in these type of tables
How to know who are the fd
How many normal forms are there dimag kharab ho raha hai.
Thank you Sir, your lectures are literally very good Sir.
Sir suppose if a question will be asked in the exam on BCNF or any other NF, will they give the candidate keys or we have to recognize.
Sir please tell how to find candidate key tomorrow is my paper in morning of nptel

Superb sir❤

Perfect teacher 💎
You are amazing thank you <br>Good bless youu❤🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿
Sir, The table is not in 3NF as it is not in 2NF bcz proper subset of C.K (Roll no.) is determining a non prime attribute that is name.
Small correction in the condition specified that is LHS should contain always super key not candidate key
But the name and age here are non prime attributes
I am doing software engineering from Pakistan and from semester 1 i am watching your videos before one day of exam and get good marks your videos are very helpful in completing my degree you make videos on each subject of Software engineering Thank you so much
Very nice
Why you should not explain in hindi we know that you know the english but we are not able understand this high level english 🙏
Sir could you make a video on 6th normal form , which is also known as dknf(Domain key normal form)
Sir yhn FD m pr 2nd nf violate ho rha h? Like ye partially dependent h
Nice
But agar roll number fucntionally dependent to name hai ... then toh 2nf hi nahi rha ab... Because partial dependency hogyi
Sir the last diagram was reverse i guess because 1nf is followed by all... universal set will be out of all the subsets ??
sir thank you very much understood all forms in one go
Thanks a ton 🥺
Jai Hind🇮🇳, Jai Hindi🕉️, Jai Shree Ram🚩🔥

i don&#39;t understand tho sir how does one determine the BCNF conditions for a table already in 3NF which means with pre-existing primary keys?
Bro here RollNo -&gt; Name i.e violating rule of 2NF
sir kaafi jagha to likha hai ki waha cd key ki jagha super key likha hai?
Why is below in BCNF?<br> R(ABCD)<br>FD: {A-&gt;B,C,D},{A,B-&gt;C,D},{A,B,C-&gt;D}<br><br>As per me,<br>it violates 2NF partial dependecy? But answer is BCNF. Can someone explain.
Agar 2nf may subset of candidate key -&gt;non prime attribute hona Nehi chahia to bcnf may kaise rollno-&gt; kaise hua
The given table is not in 2NF, how can it be in 3rd NF or BCNF?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf_PbWPo7VM&amp;t=5m44s"">5:44</a><br>vooon
This is not following 2NF
Sir YOU ARE GREAT !! Literally conquered a 5 mark question in 5 minutes! Hat’s off to you👏🏻
Selute to  u r teching sir
Sir I think last diagram mein, center me 1NF hona chahiye and last circle me BCNF. Because, inner most circle mein jo bhi hain wo definitely outer circle ke part hai but outer circle wale elements jaruri nahi inner circle ke ho.
thank u sir
if any question, they ask check whether this table is in BCNF 3NF 2NF 1NF or not. If not then make this table in BCNF 3NF 2NF 1NF so plz tell how to solve that particular question.
I speak Spanish (I&#39;m from Latin America). And of all the videos in my language that I saw, with none I could understand or only found complicated explanations and mostly without examples. And I find it incredible that I ended up in this video and with the subtitles I could understand much more than with any other video. Step by step and simple explanation. This is how everyone should teach. Thank you very much, greetings.
LHS have candidate key <br>In fourth condition voter id =roll no in this roll no also candidate key <br>Then there is two candidate key in that there is no functional depandency
Sir u teach amazingly well! I just have a simple doubt...<br>Sir in the first student example the prime attributes are partially determining the non primes ones right? So isnt it partial dependency case over there which ultimately overrules the 2nd normal form?
is this example in 2NF?
bhai i seriously want to know one thing, jinka interest hain thats okay but jiska interest hinhi hain engineering me uska socho voh kaise krrha oga engineering like me aapki videos vardaan hain bhai hamare liye, i feel aap khud peedit hain engineering se aapko deekhke lagta hain sorry dont mind but im glad to have ur videos bro 🤧🥺🥺🥺🥺

hi
Sir name aur age bhi to dependent ho skte hai ek dusre se to 3 normal form violate  nhi krega kya ?
thank you sir for last minute revisions❤️
I think you should have also shared a dataset where table was in 3nf and not in BCNF...
Shout out to the guy behind the camera who zoom in and zoom out the frame for our better understanding 🐧☺️
I have a doubt, this particular example does not satisfy 2NF or 3NF right ? cz PA:{Roll No., Voter Id} NPA:{Name, Age} and the very first FD is Roll no. --&gt; Name. Here a NPA is dependent on a PA so it should be false for 2NF and hence for 3NF ???
What language is that? I can&#39;t understand some parts of it. Is that a mix of Hindi and English?
Do know, Navdeep Singh Sodhi.....
Hwa bhi nhi lgi schi me
Sir..4nf ki video nhi ha.
I have a doubt , the table which u have shown here ..may be it is not in 2nd normal form . Because according to 2nd normal form , l.h.s. should be proper subset of candidates key and r.h.s. should be a non-prime attribute , this is condition of partial dependency . Nd in f.d. :---- roll no. → name . L.h.s is proper subset of c.k. and r.h.s. is non prime attribute so both conditions are true then there is case of partial dependency . So this is not in 2nd n.f. then how could it be in 3rd n.f. and if it is not in 3rd n.f. ...how could it in bcnf
Thanku sir you are my favourite teacher
Thank you so much sir your explanation is to good for understanding purpose it&#39;s becoming very helpful in exam sir so thanks again sir

I have a doubt 2nd normal form m bhi LHS side m c.k key hone chahiye  taki partially  dependency  na ho or same thing 4th normal form m bhi then whats  the difference  between them
I have doubt!  How is this example following 2NF ?? <br>Here RHS is non prime attribute and  partially dependent on the proper subset of candidate key.<br>So non prime is dependent on prime attribute.<br> So it&#39;s not in 2NF!<br>Please somebody explain.<br>What am I missing?
The example that you have mentioned in the beginning, doesn&#39;t satisfy the 2NF condition, right? Because in 2NF, the LHS has to have a subset and not a proper subset of candidate keys like mentioned in your previous videos. Please kindly clarify!
Keep doing sir 👍🙏
Hats off to you, sir! I have seen Normalization questions in so many interviews which has made me nervous about this topic. This is such a difficult concept to understand, but the way you explained all the details was simply brilliant. Watching your videos has quelled my fear of Normalization.
Vaise to ladka hu pr tera dedication dekh ke kiss kr ne ko mann kiyaa <br>Bro tu great hai yrr 🙏🙏🙏🙏😘😘
Sir what if LHS is a prime attribute and RHS is non prime attribute...will it still be valid for 3rd normal form?

sir thoda structured way me bataya kro kuch samajh nhi aa rha khn se start kya kr rhw ho
didnt understand.
Sir ye wali dependency to 2nd normal form me bhi nhi hoga na kyuki 2nd NF  says that: their must not be any partial dependency.. and if BD is a candidate ki then, no FD must not be dependented on either B or D separately... Aur ider to A, D pr dependented hai.. to ye to 2nd nf me bhi nhi hogi.
Sir is example mein 2NF nikalte hain to DB candidate key hai to ye individual kisi ko determine nahi karni chahiye, jabki D, A ko determine kar rahi hai, to ye to partial dependency ho gayi to 2NF mein nahi hua na, please mera ye doubt clear kijiye koi
In this video you have shown that 3nf is not &#39;dependency  preserving decomposition&#39; but your headline is Third Normal form always ensures &#39;Dependency Preserving decomposition&#39;
thanks a lot  sir..!!
hello sir if non prime determines non prime ,will it be in second normal form?
Sir, ur &#39;Ji&#39; reminds me of Diljit Dosanjh&#39;s &#39;Ji..Ji&#39; in GOOD NEWWZ movie🤣😂. Jokes apart, excellent lecture sir
While breaking ABCD, after seperating DA, why BCD is taken as R2?? Only BC should have been there
Thank you very much sir 🙏🏻

Sir, I have a doubt!<br>If there are two dataset A and B. A having 100 observations and B having 80 observations. Then what will be the output if we use left join and inner join into it.
sir if we will watch your dbms playlist full then will we able pass the college exam 2nd year student......
Sir DBMS kitna bacha h further ...

Varun sir you are the best instructor of cs
for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sabwow_e2-M&amp;t=11m22s"">11:22</a> i think the quary should be SELECT * FROM R1  JOIN R2 ON R1.B = R2.B WHERE R1.A = 1 <br><br>because on &quot;SELECT R2.c FROM R2 NATURAL JOIN R1 WHERE R1.a = 1&quot;  is giving error when i tried running it
❤️🙏❤️❤️❤️
Very clearly explained sir. Respect ++ .
sir, can you plz tell how an common attribute i.e a part of candidate key can prevent lossy decomposition?
I have no words to show gratitude towards you, you&#39;re the best teacher I have ever found, its difficult to understand 5NF, but after your lecture .. It is super easy.. Thanku so much sir, stay blessed always❤😊🎉

Thnak you sir.. your explanation is so good..
Thank you for clearing all my doubts. Your way of teaching is really good. Thank you for being there for us, Sir.
U have more knowledge about all subjects of CS.....🥰

Sir candidate key ki place pe primary key bhi bol sakte hai nn ?
Can we say that primary key should be the common attribute??
Thank you sir. It was very much Helpful. <br>I was not able to afford my Tution, so it helped me 🙏🙏
Bhai ji vaise koi real life example de sakte ho kya samjhne me aasan hoga
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sir where is the 4NF
When we are selecting candidate key (A) here i am getting exact the same table<br>R = R&#39;
Amazing Explanation
Sir have you uploaded 4NF?? it is there in my syllabus
Condition:<br>attr(r1) U attr(r2) = attr(r)<br>attr(r1) ^ attr(r2) != phi<br>r1 ck || r2 ck || r ck
Man i am having my degree just bcz of you
Good Tutorial
you are awesome i dont have much worlds to express but you are best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GHANTA KUCH SAMJHA NAHI MUJHE
Awesome Sir
To normalize a table we need to decompose the table
where is 4h NF
Thanks sir the videos is very helpful our us 😍

Your teaching skill is awesome but sound quality is poor.
Uff, 17th min end game 🖤
thanks so much sir ur explanation is really bestttttttttttt
all heroes dont wear capes
Sir common attribute should be CK or SK of R. This will be good to say.. because this we have to do before we decompose. Kindly suggest. For this example we decided that A is CK of R then we went for R1(AB) and R2(AC)
Thankx a lot sir

Sir, I wrote the exam just now<br>I saw your video before 30 mins of exam, because of you I wrote well <br>Thankyou sir❤️
thank you so much this video was very helpful !
Thank So Much Sir,,
Hindi is a beautiful language which I unfortunately don’t speak, but I understood your instruction through math. Thank you!
you are best !!!!!!!!!!!
@Gate Smashers<br> Sir in step two while taking closure of A and C why did&#39;nt you take B ??
Speak either english or your language. it&#39;s annoying when you keep mixing the languages up. Speaking english would have been better for all.
Done
Happy teacher&#39;s day ! !!!!!
is this dependency are for creating seperate table for each
Thank you so much sir to make all these topics interesting and easily understandable.
Sir, what to do if in third step , if more than two attributes determines another one .. like abc-&gt;d ?

first time in all  his lectures, i did not understand it clearly
Nice explanation sir! I don&#39;t know Hindi, But I understood from what you have taught in board. 🌠
I got the same question in my mid exam.I think the person who prepared the question paper watched the same video.😂😂
19/11/2021
👍👍💯
As per the definition given in Navathe, in minimal cover there should be single attribute at RHS. I think answer should not be d in example.
please anyone can reply that is this type of question for finding minimal cover is important for placement activities or it is only  important for university exams?
3rd step me C* = CB hoga na sir
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS-LJMTVVj8&amp;t=7m20s"">7:20</a>, while trying to remove A or C from LHS, you said we can remove either of them if the other one comes in closure. I think it should be like:<br><br>After removing A or C, if &quot;D&quot; and (not A or C) comes in the remaining attribute&#39;s closure, we can decompose it further. This is because we are trying if the dependency AC -&gt; D which derives D (RHS) can be replaced by a shorter version of LHS i.e. after removing one attribute from the composite LHS.<br><br>Please explain this.
i cant understand shit
Very Good Explanation 🤩
C clouser b a raha hai c+=bc
Excellent
Sir this concept is important for dsssb or gate point of view
very nice video thanks for making this
sir minimal cover aur canonical cover same hota?
So candidate key is not irreducable set?<br>Why?
when he said ye wala bhi single he i felt that...
kuch v samajh nhi aaya
nice 1
Thank you sir....
Thank u
yaar ab jake concept clear hua canonical cover ka............seriously bro is topic be mera dimag kharab kr dia that....thank you so much

Sir ap ke is video se muje ye topic pura clear ho gaya  thank you so much for this video..
Ty❤️
sir according to me option c is correct please recheck it and if i am wrong then reply me sir and correct my mistake
sir please check step 2 closure of c as it is extraneous attribute but you had not removed it....plz help me and make me correct in this

I think step2 aur step3 ulte ho gaye.
Bda confusion hai sir
Lots of confusion anf confusion<br>Sir, earlier you have told that the clouser of eg A-&gt;B and clouser of A will be A and B. Which we had seen in 1NF &amp; 2NF. But here you have taken the clouser of A only A. Not getting it.
Sir, I remove redundant FD&#39;s. Now I move to Step 3 &amp; have dependency like WS -&gt; R. On solving I get W -&gt; R (S is redundant). Now for dependency(W -&gt; R)  do I need to again apply step 2 ?"

Sir I think that in 3NF the test is NPA must not determine NPA and this is the only thing that matters so the table passes the 3NF and it fails the partial dependency
good one....totally samajh aa gaya...<br><br>brilliant guruji
sir ur just look like kl rahul😅🤩
Sir, My question is why didn&#39;t we check 5NF and 4NF?
Plz solve the doubt that you have told during checking the 2NF that DE is non-prime attribute but in this only D is non-prime attribute so how can this possible plz tell me i am so confused🙏🙏
I have a doubt please find the highest form of it: R (ABCDE) where FD {B-&gt;A, A-&gt;C, BC-&gt;D, AC-&gt;BE) according to above video it should be in BCNF but i got answer from book as 3NF. please clarify the doubt
Thank You Sir for such a wonderful lecture
In 3NF Non prime att. should  not determine the Non prime attr.  <br><br>C -&gt;DE<br>here we can see C is a prime attr.  therefore it is in 3NF ???<br><br>can anyone please help
lekin 3nf ki condition thi ki non candidate or superkey does not belongs to non prime attribute if this condition raised then fd is not in 3nf but here is different
I wished you speake arabic🥹
Sir u said in 3nf no non prime attribute  can define another non prime attribute but here in C-&gt;DE C is a prime attribute defining another non prime attribute d so how the table is not in 3nf??
According to GFG , Prime Attribute --&gt; Combination of ( Prime Att. + Non Prime Att. )  is allowed in 2NF,     { In this question   [ C --&gt; DE ]  }  is not a partial dependency Acc. to GFG , what is the correct answer sir ??
I am confused for 3NF. In previous videos it says no non prime Attribute should define non prime attribute. either it should be part of Prime Attribute or Candidate key. so second FD that is C-&gt;DE. Here C is a Prime Attribute defining non prime. or it must be only CK. Can any one explain? and why check from Top to bottom why not bottom to top. I first checked for 2NF and got the answer that its not in 2NF, so there&#39;s no need to check 3NF and so on.
I am a big fan of your way of teaching.
What happens when there are no Candidate keys? Please tell.
Thankyou sir , helped me so much for last minute preparation of exam❤
in previous video of 3nf you said a prime attribute can derive a non attribute for R to be in 3NF but here here C which is a prime attribute is deriving a non prime attribute in not in 3NF   h0w?
thank you sir you are a amazing teacher i ever seen in my entier student journey love you <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
If we check the E-&gt;F in 2 NF it doesn&#39;t follow but we tick that FD because it is in 3NF can anyone tell me why?
at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h8VoRnRvnE&amp;t=13m29s"">13:29</a>, he says, 1 NF me bhi ho sakti h. But jab koi table BCNF me h to 3,2,1 NF me bhi surely hogi hi na ?
Confusing topic explained so easily 😃
love from pak ❤
❤❤
But sir you said for 3NF we just have to check one condition i.e non-prime attribute should not determine non-prime attribute and in this example, this condition is true. So, why is it not in 3NF ?? plz reply sir
Great explanation bro🤓
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h8VoRnRvnE&amp;t=18m00s"">18:00</a> the answer should be 3NF, sir
Why cannot we directly check for 2nd NF...if that fails then we don&#39;t have to proceed further?
Sir jb Ap lecture dyte Hain end py white board Sy side py hat jayia kry because screen shot lyna hota hai.
You are great but if you used attributes name like name, id, phoneno instead of alphabetic letters, it will be more easy.<br>Thank you Mr Varun
sir highest norm if possible is 5NF  so why we don&#39;t start from 5NF, 4 NF but we start from BCNF? (as per previous lectures)
Sir, second functional dependency is in 3 NF, because C is prime attributes<br>3 NF says that Non prime attributes must not derive non prime attributes
🙏🙏🙏🙏
if table is not in 2NF how is it supposed to be in any higher normalization forms....in 3NF relations need first to be in 2NF same goes for BCNF
30 done.100 more to go😇
Every student of SMIT depend on you //
sir please upload 2nf topic again we can&#39;t understand properly due to audio glitch..🙏
Sir, is it not required to check it from the 5th nf?
Aapa
Aapaaa
half of lpu students depend on you
We don&#39;t have words to show gratitude to you Sir 🙏😊💐
if the given relation will be 4 NF and 5NF then?
Thank you sir...Because of your classes I have cleared my dbms exam....
is this not even in 1 nf as it have multivalued attributes
Lec:29
If any of you have a confusion in 3NF:-<br>A functional dependency X-&gt;Y is a transitive dependency, if X is not candidate key or super key and Y is a non-key attribute(s).<br>Hope it helps
Why are you saying that BCNF is highest....What about the fourth and fifth normal forms.
For those who are confused with C-&gt;<a href=""http://de.in/"">DE.In</a> 3NF lhs should be candidate or superkey or rhs should be prime <a href=""http://attribute.so/"">attribute.So</a> for C-&gt;D correct and for C-&gt;E incorrect.And we know if we get a single cross that level <a href=""http://cancel.so/"">cancel.So</a> he has done it in a single column. Same for 2NF As C is a subset of a candidate and  E is non-prime so C-&gt;E cross.But C-&gt;D is correct. But doesn&#39;t matter as a cross already exists.
❤️❤️💕💕
c-&gt;DE BUT d is non prime but E ids prime so DEis how prime attribute
My problem is cleared about normalisation in this video.thank you sir 😊
20 minutes of this lecture taught me more than 20 hours of my college professor&#39;s lecture 🥺 thank you 💙
Thank you so much sir <br>Kl Mera semester exam  h DBMS ka aur mne saari videos dekhli aapki DBMS ke upper aur ab mujhe pta h ki main pass ho jaonga aapki videos dekh ke<br>Fan From Karnal, Haryana ❤️❤️
this one question almost coverd all the topics of database design
Shouldn&#39;t highest normal form be 4th or 5th?
You&#39;re great sir 👍 thank you so much for clarifying my all doubts
Great sir
Perfect
Sir I have a doubt on CK<br>If a relation may have more than one CK then we should define all CKs or only define the minimal CK?<br>Because in case to check PA and NPAs can we only check the attributes those present in minimal CK?<br><br>Please help how to solve this query!!
Why are we checking for partial dependency in 2NF?<br>Rule for 2NF Is that all the non prime attributes should be fully functional dependent on the candidate key and we also know that C is not a candidate key so why don&#39;t we skip that part?
A relation R(ABCDE) with functional dependencies as below is given find the highest normal form of the relation. AB-&gt;C, BC-&gt;D,CD-&gt;E
For 2 nd in case of C-&gt;DE  D is non prime attribute but E is not, then what we will consider it .... 🙄, As prime or non prime ....? <br>Anyone kindly help me out of this confusion
Sir please reply to this comment if you see<br>In 3NF prime attribute is determining non prime attribute( C-&gt;D) which means transitive dependency not exists then it should be in 3NF right?
AB-&gt;C is not in 2NF but is in 3NF,How?
Thankyou
While checking 2NF, <br>if LHS ia proper subset of ck it bedcoems partially dependent right?<br>EB is Ck, then E is a proper subset<br>E--&gt;F has partial dependency right? how is it in 2nf
Sir how do you check for 4NF and 5NF
Thank you! It is really helping me in my preparation.
Sir, why are we not considering 4NF AND 5NF TO BE HIGHEST?
BEST BEST BEST<br>THANKU FOR THIS AMAZING COURSE SIR❤
Sir you not say in this video at last,  what is the highest normal form in this journal table ? Please reply this comment
<b>Thank me later:)</b><br><br><b>BCNF:</b> Left side of all FD should be a <b>CK</b> <b><i>OR</i></b> <b>SK</b><br><b>3NF:</b> Left side should be a <b>CK</b> <b><i>OR</i></b> right side should be a <b>prime attribute</b><br><b>2NF:</b> There should be no FD such that left side is a proper subset of any <b>CK</b> <b>AND</b> right side is a <b>no-prime attribute</b><br><b>1NF:</b> No multivalued attribute for any row
Ur lectures are best. I was always confused in normalization and functiinal dependencies. But this is the best dbms course which is free of cost and available to all.
Good explanation

sir if candidate key is minimal then here &quot;C&quot; should be candidate key not &quot;CB&quot; please explain if i am wrong
start with 3NF. Apply binary search method 😂
Sir DB kyu nhi liye candidate key mein
Im in <a href=""http://b.tech/"">b.tech</a> 3rdy My sir Fully copy your video lecture wise and im one  lecture ahead   then Sir because of you thank you sir you can teach very simply and most important we can understand more easily ❤️❤️❤️
best video till now
sir in this video C also must be candidate key
19/11/2021
Awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeee Sir.
Mujhe laga kuch nahi samjhega normalisation mai but iss question se sab clear hogaya
Thankyou😇
<a href=""https://youtu.be/awhvPD_cdRw"">https://youtu.be/awhvPD_cdRw</a>
You are awesome  sir 🤞☺️
Thanks for this awesome explanation
Thank you sir ❤️❤️
very good explanation sir
why are we taking all in prime attributes....there can be only one primary key from all the candidates key...so only 2 attributes should be there in prime attributes??? not all which are present in candidate key
In 3NF C--&gt;DE ,C is not a CK but in DE,E is prime attribute. Then it is true naa ??
Sir Kya RDBMS me bhi normalization aise hi hoga............???? Plzz bata diyega jab bhi apko tym mile.
Please clear my doubt; while we check for 3rd NF, we check for the condition of Transitive Dependency right, which is in the above video, for E-&gt;F, we see if LHS is CK or RHS is PA; in this case, F is PA, and so we conclude it satisfies Transitive Depenecy (In the video, sir had ticked it). <br><br>But according to 3RD NF, there should be NO Transitive Depency right, then how come we agree/tick something(E-&gt;F, F-&gt;A) that satisfies Transitive dependency and reject something (C-&gt;DE) that does not satisfy Transitive Dependency?
This video is kinda Awesome 😍❤️
The heading for this video: Best revision of all the normalization techniques till bcnf

Can anyone explain how r2 is in bcnf and how c is candidate key there
Sir jb hm 2nd normal form. Check kr rhe the tb C-&gt;D prblm create kr rha taah tb hmne R1 and R2 bnaya taah tb bhi hmne usse join kiya taah without any commnone attribute??
Thank you so much sir.
THANKS A LOT SIR JI😊
in lecture 29 while checking 2NF AB is not a proper subset but you tick it on the base of BCNF and 3NF. in this video you are saying AB is not a proper subset so it is false mixing concept kindly make it clear<br>🥲
r1 ko BCNF k liye decompose krne ke baad joh  4 table aa rhen h unki funtional dependency toh origianl table se bilkul same h , koi change hi nhi h toh yahan BCNF functionallity preserving kr raha h ?
How R1(ABCEF) is is 3NF if  transitive dependency is there which is C-&gt;E, E-&gt;F, SO C-&gt;F ? can anyone explain.
Awesome explanations sir...hats off
Wow Sir itne mushkil concept ko aapne kitne ache se samajhaya hai.😌😌
Thnkew  so much  Sir . You teaching style are incredible. 👌👌
1.5x <br>ilyhac

I,m confused in one thing ..that in 2 normal form there should be no partial dependency then why E ➡️F is in full dependency .
Thank you so much 🙏🙏

the quality of the lecture is far ahead of nptel lectures and many more youtube lectures keep it up sir😍
Really amazing well explained concept.
I have a doubt in 3NF there shouldn&#39;t be any transitive property, transition means LHS:CK or RHS:Prime attribute .so for a table to be in 3NF there should not be a CK in LHS or no prime attribute in RHS,but its there in the example ,so table is not in 3rd NF right ,pls explain
good explanation sir thank you.
Its incredible how easy you make all these topics... DBMS, DAA, CN, OS... seen all playlists
Last ka 3 min me to sir aap new haircut ke saath aaye hain..... Wo bhi r1,r3,and r4 ko join karane🙏👍😎🤘
jb r2 2nd NF mai ni hai toh vo BCNF mai kaise hogaa ???<br>kyuki jb r2 2nd NF mai ni hhai toh 3rd NF mai bhi ni hoga toh BCNF mai bhi  ni hoga
Awesome lecture it was🖤
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJjpH2RUcQ&amp;t=21m30s"">21:30</a> : sir got a haircut and came again<br>Priorities
Jb ye table 2NF me h hi ni to 3NF me kaise ho gya?
one dout i have<br>as far as you are changing its to higher normal form <br>how you assumme that the lhs part is candidate key which were not before when  you decompose the table
outstanding teaching .....
Really great teaching!!!

Sir I had a doubt @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJjpH2RUcQ&amp;t=10m06s"">10:06</a> ki decompose karne ke baad whether R2 is in 2NF or not?
Ultimate...
Thankyou sir
Sir, R4 and R2 have the same primary key, is there any issue in merging the tables to get a new R7(C,D,E)
Don&#39;t we also need minimal cover to start the normalisation process? Anyone please confirm
After decomposition we get the third normal form or else we won&#39;t get third normal form. Because C is not a candidate key... Please help
THE LECTURES<br> SHOULD BE PAID....thank you so much dear...sir, love and respect from PAKISTAN
Sir,There exist Two tranisitive property b/w R1( ABCEF) AB-C and C-E  &amp; C-E and E-F.thats why I guess there will be 5 separate relation For 3NF R1(ABC) R2(CE) R3(EF) R4(FA) and R5(CD)... same as BCNF...
Your lectures are priceless
Useful to me 👍
How to find highest normal form when fd is not given while attributes and combined primary key is given in the question???
Sir one question is there......<br>Suppose there is one functional dependency which is not validating the property of PARTIAL DEPENDENCY but it is not also validating this property -&gt;&gt;&gt; (Non Prime Attribute must be fully dependent on Candidate Key) then this functional dependency will be a valid for SECOND NORMAL FORM or not???<br>Sir please solve my doubt...I&#39;ll be very grateful
Best Normal Form explanation...💯💯💯
Amazing Sir, no one can teach normal form concepts THIS clearly except you!! I’m forever thankful to you for these lectures! 👏🏼

Sir 1 doubt when the table was first splitted you took the same set of cks   for the r1 table which were given in the question. Since c-&gt;d is removed from the table the ck set will also get modified right?
crystal clear explanation
Sir,i am getting very much interest  in DBMS because of your awesome teaching style......Thankyou very much Sir...
Sir, the Whole board is not clearly visible. Tell your cameraman to manage the proper setup.
English?
if a prime attribute determines a non prime attribute, will it violate 3 NF?

Sir in main exam can I write candidate key trick for finding candidate key
Thank you sir
I think answer should be 5 of q2<br>Apart from 4 combinations, 1st D should also include as candidate key
I have covered till now, and i am serious sir, you are a god!

Sir, the diagram or hierarchy is incorrect ,it is in reverse order.
Hat&#39;s off sir ji
Sir please tell me which book should I prefer for  question preparation of GATE/ISRO/DRDO.
sir,,,plz teach in english ,its helpful to all <br>thank i
Suppose if .....candidate key find krne ke pehle step me....<br>RHS side me sare hi attributes mil Gaye    <br>Relation ke....fer kese second step pe jayenge....
Sir ABD  and BCD can also be candidate keys so answer should be d i.e 6
onsider the schema R(S,T,U,V) and the dependencies S→T, T→U, U→V, V→S. Let R= {R1,R2} such that R1∩R2=Φ. Then the decomposition is :<br>[A] not in 2NF<br>[B] in 2NF but not in 3NF<br>[C] in 3NF but not in 2NF<br>[D] in both 2NF and 3NF<br>Sir plz help

Sir Apne vein diagram opp bnaya  .. i mean 1nf should b inner circle n bcnf in outer circle... which means the same if relation is in bcnf it&#39;s in 3nf 2nf n 1st normal form though explanation is right )🙏 correct m if I m wrong
Sir, kya aap June 2019 ugc net k question provides kra dege

In Schema 2 how can a rollno. be  a candidate key because it doesn&#39;t determine courseid  ?
Kindly clarify these imp doubts sir:<br>In Schema 2, email bhi prime attribute hoga na? <br>In Schema 4, kya hum aur reduce nahi kar sakte? Reduce karke sirf Course-&gt;Credit bachti hai.
bahut Bdhiya Bahut Badhiya
Is this question really came into gate cse ??
Sir, in schema 2, we found a CK = (roll no, Course id) , now we can replace &#39;roll no&#39; wih &#39;email&#39; , so another CK is (email,Course id) . Therefore, each attribute should be prime attribute, but you didn&#39;t check for other candidate keys and wrote &#39;email&#39; as a non prime attribute.
sir 2nd schema main email to non prime hai to 3rd normal form main kaise
Sir prime attributes we will write from candidate key 🔑 sir here why we have wrote from primary key sir <br>We have find candidate keys 🤔🤔 before proceeding <br>Anyone please clarify my doubt
Aap konse college ke professor he
nice explanation. we need you in our college. our teacher is from it but he sucks at teaching
You are a magician 🙇
Sir in the previous video you told that in order to be a propersubset it must be lesser than the given set, here you are breaking the condition(Or so it seems to me) kindly help
what a example and u helped to solve it in a easy way which covers all the nf.. great teaching style... Thanks a lot  : )
perfect explanation
In Schema 2 according to your previous videos of determining candidate keys, if we check<br>courseId is not on R.H.S. means we must take that on lhs.<br>cid+=cid<br>(rollno,cid)+=rolno,cid,email<br><br>Now rollno is present on rhs of email so we can replace rollno with email<br>(email,cid)+=email,cid,rollno<br><br>that means email will also be included in candidate key set
you r god sir, please teach in our college NMIT,Bangalore

Sir 3NF ke liye to NPA NPA ko determine nhi krna chahiye na?? Is br to aapne 2NF ki condition check ki hai 3NF ke liye (PA NPA ko determine nhi krna chahaiye)
Thank you so much sir ❤️😊
i have just binge watched this series till this lecture from 1st in one day , i can&#39;t even see the money heist this way.....loved it guru....
In 4th question when courseid -&gt;credit .... according to the 3rd Normal you said one condition that non-prime attribute should not determine a non prime but here courseid is a prime attribute determining a non prime attribute which is credit...so in this case it should be in 3rd normal form but if we check with another method which you mentioned in this vedio than that&#39;s okay so which method to follow?
sr, you have written for bcnf lhs must be candidate key or super key or primary key , but at the time of 14.10 you simply speaking for bcnf ,lhs must must be candidate key,plz guys reply anyone cause i&#39;ve watched 4 times still having a doubt
Schema 2 : Another CK will be {Email, CourseId}. Isn&#39;t it?
Thank you for teaching us
very good and quality explanation never watch anyone doing it very easy way where subject is DBMS😍
Sir in second schema i think the candidate keys must be { (roolno. courseid), (email courseid) }, can someone give clarification?
Now normalization is inside my subconscious mind because of you sir thanks
Best DBMS tutorial ever🔥
Thank you sir..
Honorable Sir!<br>In Schema &quot;2&quot;, Although it is still in 3NF but<br>@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFdvRm5nse0&amp;t=4m19s"">4:19</a> : email should be P.A., because along with (roll,c_id), (email,c_id) should be CK, because email-&gt;roll_no, that&#39;s why email-&gt;roll_no ={PA-&gt;PA) SO it is in 3NF.<br>STILL THE WAY, YOU TEACH, IS INCOMPARABLE😊
What a playlist!!!!! Enjoying like a movie . Thank you very much sir .
Worth watching .....Thank You!! Would recommend this to everyone.
Run sir r ur vdos enough for preparing ugc net ???
best way of teaching
thanks sir for giving this type of content.....
I was having doubt in schema 3 , in 2NF RHS is a non prime attribute in that case it is not in 2NF
great collection of examples
Tqq So much sir.. Great way of teaching..<br>I have subscribed to your channel and don&#39;t skip ads..<br>Thank you for this Playlist...
schema 2 should also have candidate key emailid+courseid
What is exactly BCNF&#39;s condition ?! <br>We&#39;ve to check for a FD whether &quot; LHS is Candidate Key  &quot; or whether &quot; LHS is Candidate Key/Super Key / Primary Key &quot; ?! Is it only Candidate key or can be any of the three keys ?!
The best teacher!
Mujhe lagta tha mein yah sab kabhi nhi samjh paunga but kamaal kar diya

Sir you explain it so well.. Tomorrow is my exam and all my concepts got cleared
Thank you sir, baar baar normalization ke condition likh kr yad ho gye
In the 3rd schema ...Both marks and grade are non prime attributes ...Then how is it in 2nf ..<br>Condition of 2nf is ...No partial dependency and non prime attribute must fully depend upon candidate key
Schema3: in ur previous video it was explained that for a schema to be in 2nd NF, a schema should be a PD (OR) &quot;All the Non Prime Attributes should be fully functional dependent on candidate key&quot;. If I go with the 2nd definition mentioned here (based on ur previous video of 2nd NF) , than schema3 is not in 2nd NF because marks - grade is not according to the defination. Please correct me if Im wrong.
The best teacher!
in schema 2 :    {roll no course id <br>                              email course id } they both are the candidate   keys. so i think we are having 3 prime attributes (still it does not affect <br>the answer because  according to third normal form LHS must be a candidate key OR RHS is non prime attribute) . The rest is well explained  and awesome professor.....by far the best videos i have found on dbms hats off sir for such valuable free content
thank you Sir,   <br>You teches very well,thanks alot again.
Thanks you very much!!!
Best explained ☺️🙌
Iam little bit confused with 2nf conditions..can anybody explain me please
schema3 mein ak confusion hy . Partial dependency check  krny k liye rule hy k ( L.h.s must be proper subset of CK and R.h.s must be non prime attribute ). agr Partial dependency ki ye dono condition false ho gi to hi Schema 2NF mein ho ga. lekin schema 3 main R.h.s mein NPA araha hy phr ye 2NF mein kasy howa??? please explain kr dain
in schema 4,how the composite candidate key is be the proper subset of that that candidate key?if it is is wrong then how can be the pd be true?&amp; how can it not be 2nf?
Thank you so much sir
The explanation is crystal clear. Note: Sir, I think,  in schema 2 , ck: {roll_no+course_id , email_id+course_id}.
Thank you so much
Thnx a lot Sir,aap bhut acha smjhate hai ,aise agar mere clg me padhaya jata na bache top krte sare.Bhut kam teachers hai jo itne ease k sath smjha dete hai.<br>Thanks a lot 😊👍
Thanks a lot Sir
Tabahi macha di
sir aap plz humare college me aa jao padhane ,our college should have professor like u
Very helpful video to understand normalization in DBMS form this question<br>Thank you so much sir 😊<br>I&#39;m very happy to watch this video
10/10 delivery of lectures Sir
Perfect explanation sir, thank you so much for clear my concept
Well explain
Thanks bro
Always loved your teaching style. You are clearing my concepts very well. Great fan of you.
In schema 4, <br>Roll_no, course_id is candidate key.<br>As per 2NF condition ,LHS should be proper subset of CK And RHS should be non-prime attribute.<br>So, LHS is not a proper subset of CK. Then how, this is in 2NF?
In 2nd schema there are two candidate keys.
Kamaal karte ho jiii.....
thank q sir.......very well expained"

Thanks bro ❤
Nice understandable lecture but very tricky X covers Y then we take y&#39;s closure but check into X.. It&#39;s make confusion

Sir ye same question net m aaya tha good explanation
bahut badhiya bhaiya!!!
Very well done.....super explanation🙂
Nice
👍 😀 😊 🙏 👏 👌 👍🙏
Here sir,<br>Closure of A should be A and C      <br>bcz sir AB -&gt; CD is composition of A -&gt; C and B -&gt; D from Composition Rule sir.<br>Therefore, <br>Closure of B Should be B and D <br>Closure of BC should be BCD and So the FD&#39;s are<br>BC -&gt; D and B -&gt; CD  are also included sir bcz on taking closure of both with above conditions we determine the required values.<br>So the Resultant FD&#39;s are<br>{ D -&gt; A ,<br>  BC -&gt; D ,<br>  BD -&gt; C ,               <br>  B -&gt; CD }      <br>and then For checking Preservation of FD <br>Here , D -&gt; A is preserved but For AB we have to take closure of AB from Resultant FD <br>So Closure Of AB Should be ABCD.<br>Therefore, AB -&gt; CD is also Preserved. <br>@GateSmasher

One doubt, while determining the FDs for R2 table (BCD), why did we not consider the simpler FDs like B -&gt; C, C -&gt; B, C -&gt; D, D-&gt; C, B -&gt; D and D -&gt; B?

Sir in this question, isn&#39;t it given that D-&gt;A and BD-&gt;C, so won&#39;t it be BA=BD, and then BA-&gt;C, so we will achieve the original FD
Sir please make tutorials for engineering maths as well
Thanks great video sir

Thnkss alott sir..
very nice explanation, your lectures are really awesome for competative examinations, <br>I&#39;m learning from your lectures and solving competitive problems very easily.
Legitimate Sir. Sir please make videos on information security course.
sir can you please tell if given decomposition is dependency preserving or not. X(PQRS) FD= { QR -&gt; S, R -&gt; P, S -&gt; Q} decomposed to Y(PR) AND Z(QRS) this question is from gate 2019
Thank you sir 🙂
Sir is this the only method to solve this ques..... Or we can solve. It by key concept like in R1 and R2  D is common so D should be key in any of the decomposed relation sir plz reply I m right or wrong

Ans toh batao
Great Explanation :)<br>Oct;4, 2023 05:32 pm
Bhaiya notes dbms hai kya
Hi,<br>Let me share my opinion in a very humble manner:<br>This is a wrong example, as dept_id should be a foreign key in the employee table instead of emp_id in the department table because many employees can work in 1 department but 1 employee cannot have many departments.
Respect from Pakistan. Great teacher, great style of teaching.
Sir your video is very helpful ❤
Sir i can&#39;t  find the video of conditional join .can u send me the link sir.
If you explain in English that could be more helpful. Some times unable to understand. Could you please do video on joins with English !!!!
Happy Teachers day
Nice 👍
This exaple  will be more appropriate  if you mention  Dno  column in employee table rather eno column in department table

i like you!!!
@ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYH-e6tUYbw&amp;t=5m10s"">5:10</a>) you added Employee id as foreign Key in Department table that means -<br>1. Department hasOne Employee<br>2. Employee belongsToMany Department<br><br>Ideally the relationship should be reversed.<br>Isn&#39;t it? <br>Thanks
respected sir, you are Excellent teacher. Kindly clear that let say our table Emp contain 100 rows and Dept contain 100 rows then Natural join will result into 1000 rows?

Right
too many unnecessary statements. you could&#39;ve gave a little definition to foreign key in the time you consumed far much for &#39; go to my prev videos&#39;. if you remove the unnecessary emphasizing it was only a 4 minute video felt like I wasted my time.

Very nice sir
Sir please make a playlist of Java programming also
If I want to make a table by combining columns from more than two tables, For example one column from one table, two columns from another table, two columns from 3rd table and one column from 4th table, then how will I get to know that which join to use ??

Natural joins rely solely on column names, which can be risky if tables have columns with the same name but represent different data. Using explicit joins with the ON keyword ensures that you explicitly define the relationship between tables.
You are a great teacher
Thoda fast bataya Karo. Bht chote se concept ko bht slowly btatae ho
Seriously in my whole engineering career and infact today when I am preparing for interview, I only trust your tricks... Thank you Gate Smasher ❤️ you&#39;re saviour
Sir, Bohot achese smjhate ho aap. Bohot punya milega aapko from all the students :)
Best Teacher Ever
You are amazing brother
Why there are no such professors in college like him
What if both the columns have more than one column in common?  What shall be the output in that case?
Amazing.
Hats off to you, clear explanation of a important topic.
what is the query for the given problem sir? you didnt write the query .
Very Nice Explanation Sir , Thank You.
Ossom sir ji🎉🎉🎉
A best explained one but I could understand only  by looking the subtitles in English. so it&#39;s better to use English language to explain because anyone knows English.
Today I found the right teacher ❤ really you are great dada❤
What about the data type of the common attribute,it also needs to be same throughout the two tables or it doesn&#39;t matter?
thanks sir
we can use right join as well in the first example i guess
very nice concept solving sir ....garibo ka massiha ho aap<br> ..
Who is here 2023? Inner join for SQL brought me to your page and it&#39;s like I&#39;m in a direct class with a professor. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and for the Subtitles to us Non-Hindi.
Nice
Phle long table dekh k lga k.. difficult hai..lekin at the end ese smjh aya k ab..to kbhi ni bhule ga yeh concept 😅😂😂
Thankyou so much for explaining so easy
Thanks sir
Maja aagya
Make me understand so clearly. Thank you sir.
IS THERE COMPLETE SQL TUTORIAL FROM scrtch to advance, or is there online training
def thankyou():<br>           x=&#39;subscribed&#39;<br>           print(x)<br>thankyou()
Ise bolte h tutorial jisse smj m b aaya or dbms b clear ho gya

Sir plzz make a vdo on diff in between natural join and inner join.
Sir natural join how to use in algebra.
loved all of your videos :) man keep it coming :) <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
Sir if more than one same attributes are present in the relation than what will be the syntax for that
Joins kab batayega poora video dekh liya
Osm vedio bro thanks you so much
Thank you soo much Sir
syntax error occured
👍 😀 😊 🙏 👏 👌 👍🙏
sir we ca do this using inner join as well then why to use natural join
Hoga na
Emp.Emp_id= department.department_id
Video starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRxEjmjIIFs&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> thank me later
kal interview hai sir, thank you
Your video is very helpful 🙂
Thank you Sir 🙏🙏
Sir please make a video on key difference between Equi join,Natural join and Inner join.Many students get confused with it ?
Kamal sir g
nice and clear explanation
Sir thank you for this video 🙂. Sir can I write the 1st query that you wrote first, instead of writing the 2nd one?  Will these both query give same output?
Baraabar rkhna hai
i dont get it, many sites say natural join is not a cross product and removes duplicacy; meaning the resultant relation will contain a single copy of the resultant attribute...not both of them from tables...unlike cross join/cartesian product
You have to explained queries in symbolics representation?
Select &lt;common field name&gt; from &lt;first table&gt; natural join &lt;2nd table&gt;<br><br>Your final query looks wrong to me, when I tried to run in my ssms it failed with syntax error.
Doubt: Sir why you didn&#39;t include Address from Emp table and Name from Dept table
Really you are genius sir .................
thankyou sir
natural join  is applicable for more than two tables??
Thank U So Much Sir !
Hello Sir, U explanation is fantastic and clears all the doubts but this I m having a problem Can u please help m out... What will be the query to find the emp name who is working in a department D2? ... It&#39;s ur table only the one u used in this video&#39;s example....please tell me do we have to use &quot;ON&quot;??<br><br>Select e_name from emp,dept on emp.e_no=dept.e_no where dept.dept_no = D2;    <br>                  OR<br>SELECT e_name from emp, dept where emp.e_no =dept.e_no and dept.dept_no =D2;<br><br>Which query is correct Sir?...plzz help me sir
Fan of u r teaching.. writing all cross product  really shows how query executes thank you so much
great guru jii 👏👏
great as @gatesmasher
Tysm... it&#39;s really helpful for knowing the logic behind it.
this is so amazing now i have cleared the concept of natural join.
can we write or swap dept.e_no = emp.e_no  instead of   emp.e_no=dept.e_no  in any joins format ???
can i say natural join is also called cross join?<br> can you plz clear my concept?
inner join natural join e hota ha?
Thank you so much for this video but can you also tell me that if we want the output which involves more than 3 tables then how can we use this join
I m in love with your dbms playlist ❣️❣️❣️
Bhai kya mast explain karte ho, kya concepts clear hue mai ekdum satik. Love you bro!

crazy explaination
Thank you soo much respected Sir <br>May Almighty Allah bless you ❤
there will be 2 sane records S1 or a single S1
Agar mujhe koi itna pyaar se padhta toh mein Top karti.
LOOKED FOR SO MANY IDEOS BUT ALL HAE SAME EXAMPLE,THANKYOU FOR THIS
1 question varun sir that is when alis consider for a single table in sql does it copy the named table??
Not understand this topic
can this be done in some other way as well? group by or distinct, idk m just thinking 🤔 will try later on
can&#39;t we write same query using left join?
Wow! very well explained.
Thanks sir ...
Thank you bhai - for the information off self join
very very effective example. this video is a magic... thank u so much dada...
Hi - I have a doubt.. Will the output print the S-id twice ? Don&#39;t we need to use distinct here? Please explain and thanks for the video.. Its helpful and one stop solution for entire DBMS.. But please clear my doubt ?
What is this not equal to sign?
Hello sir, please aap syntax or definition bhi de sakte ho kya video or jyadda easy ho jayga samjne me...
Output mein ek line 2 baar ari esa ho skta h ki line ek hi baar aye?
select s_id from sc as t1,  sc as t2 where t1.s_id = t2.s_id and t1.c_id&lt;&gt;t2.c_id LIMIT 0, 1000	Error Code: 1052. Column &#39;s_id&#39; in field list is ambiguous	0.000 sec <br>i am getting this error please help me with it
very well explained. Loved it and shared it. <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
sir you are literally a gem.<br>thanks for making such amazing videos.
what kind of join is this ?? because you have not mentioned any join keyword in your query
Nice explanation sir. Just one question, can we solve the same problem using group by?
Your great sir
From Bangladesh! Awesome ...........!!!! WOW
what is the difference between composite primary key, primary key and candidate key?
Great Explanation. Good Work . Could you please help me understanding one scenario. I have to find out the consecutive date doctor is available. <br><br>Date              Available<br>11-06-2016	1<br>12-06-2016	1<br>13-06-2016	0<br>14-06-2016	1<br>15-06-2016	0<br>16-06-2016	0<br>17-06-2016	1<br>18-06-2016	1<br>19-06-2016	1<br>20-06-2016	1<br>21-06-2016	1<br><br><br>and i have come up with this query : <br><br>select  d1.d_Date from DOCTOR_AVAILABILTY d1, DOCTOR_AVAILABILTY d2<br>where d1.d_date = d2.d_Date + 1 <br>and d1.d_availability = 1 and d2.d_availability = 1. <br><br>I am getting output as <br>12-06-16<br>18-06-16<br>19-06-16<br>20-06-16<br>21-06-16<br><br>But i am expecting the output to be <br>11-06-16<br>17-06-16<br>18-06-16<br>19-06-16<br>20-06-16<br><br>Because i am selecting the date from first table i.e d1. So now as per the condition (11-06-16 = 12-06-16). Here d1 date is 11-06-16 and d2 date is 12-06-16. So why is it returning 12-06-16. <br><br>Explanation to this would be appreciated.

This video was really helpful for me to understand self-join; however I do have a question. What is the point of self join if we can get the output through subquery? I mean joining a table with itself doesn&#39;t make sense in general. So, please help me understand why and in which scenarios it is used? What are the scenarios where self join could be preferred more than any alternate solution?
you really got a gift from God in teaching bro. Thanks!!
Thank you so much for this!!! By the way, we can solve the query without using self join as well using, SELECT S_ID FROM STUDENT GROUP BY S_ID HAVING COUNT(C_ID)&gt;1;
Sir you are outstanding
distinct keyword should also be used
Thank You Sir for making the concepts understandable , for making me confident , for motivating ❤❤ Thank You for Everything. You are really a great teacher.
Great sir
Sir is question m humee distinct bhi use Krna hoga na nhi to S1 2 baar print ho jayega ??
If sid &amp; cid is a primary key then we can&#39;t repeat s1 &amp; c2 again in this example...
This lecture is help me a lot,l can&#39;t explain in word..just amazing 😍
👍 😀 😊 🙏 👏 👌 👍🙏
Ambiguous aaa raha hai bhai
Kal Mera ppr Hai r Mery jitny v marks ay ge srf r srf apki wja c 🫠🥹beshtttt teacher forever 🫡
We can solve this question using the below mentioned subquery :<br><br>select s_id from study group by s_id having count(c_id) &gt;=2;
I reald online about self join everywhere but now i inderrtood thank you💜💜
select * from student S group by s_id having count(*)&gt;=2.  Should this work? little simple
What if we only want a student who is enrolled in EXACTLY 2 COURSES?
Hello Sir...Thank You so much you explained very well... I told my  all grp to subcribed... Almost 98 person would be join in fev days😊
Sir please make a video on key difference between Equi join,Natural join and Inner join.Many students get confused with it ?
we have to use distinct right as it give two s_id&#39;s.<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
😊😊😊😊😊
Dear sir you are great
Thank you so much Sir 🙏😊💐<br>You are the best teacher I have seen yet 🙏😊💐
if i ll put for more than 3 course thn how on clouse should be written(obiously not for this example)
Nice Video
Wow man your -explanation is just on point boyyy

very well taught sir, great video!!<br>Bas ek cheez correct karni thi mujhe, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DQpvfdj6EE&amp;t=12m49s"">12:49</a> pe aapne galat row ko sahi wala maana.....sahi wala row uske upar tha<br><br>Otherwise everything else was perfect, mere concepts clear kar diye aapne! :D
need to use the distinct keyword otherwise the dublicates value will be generated
awsm ❤️
Thanku so much sir 🌞.you are one of the best teacher ever ❤️
sir aap bhaut zada shi smjatay ho 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌😎😎😎😎
I&#39;m mechanical undergrad preparing for data analyst and your this series make me so easy to understand.
will this not print s1 two times we want it only once right?

Sir aap bahut achcha samjhate hai thanks Sir
Really very informative and mind-blowing explanation
What if we have to output query for at least 3 courses?
Thank you
select SID from Practice group by SID having count(SID)&gt;=2;   this one also give result
Very well explained , appreciate the effort that you put in explaining in detail
i now like videos before watching them and as the complete it seems worth it
is self join the same thing as inner join?
But the final table contains same value more than once ....how to remove that anyone ❓❓❓
Bahut badiya
will S1 get printed twice or only once?
In case of, atleast   3 courses??
Nice explanation and teaching technique far better than coaching institute.
Thanks to you and youtube subtile lol. this was very helpful.
Sir, I was trying to create Table name math but couldnt create, may I know the reason
Its so helpful. thank you so much . lots of love from Nepal
very helpfull
I really appreciate your efforts and time you&#39;re putting in, but I recommend you reading Learing SQL_Third Edition (Chapter five, Page115) for better explanation. It lists the conditions when you&#39;re actually able to do the self join and why you should go for self join.  :D
thanks alot sir, sir when i run this query on sql live  &quot;select t.sid from study as t,study as e where t.sid=e.sid and t.cid&lt;&gt;e.cid;&quot;then error occur SQL command  not ended properly ...can you help me plz.🙄
Sir , I have a Question ?<br>Q. Why use SELF JOIN ?
i love you............u are nothing less than everything.......
sir infinite course kaise ho site hai??? 2,3 tak tik tha .
Bhai yaar acha sikhate ho but itna slow math sikhao neend aata hai itna baar same statements repeat kyu karta hai bhai
Great, very well explained
plz explain in english or add subtitles

Select e_name from employee as e ,deparment as d<br>where e.e_no = d.e_no and e.address = d. location
2022✌️
SELECT e_name FROM emp NATURAL JOIN dept WHERE address = location;<br>This query is also woking for the same.
2022
Amazing!
Sir, I have a query.  Will there be any problem if we write &quot;select Emp.E_name&quot; in place of &quot;select E_name&quot;? In your previous videos you taught us to write table.column_name, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking this. It will be helpful if you can ans my question.
If it is english video then useful to all.  This is only useful for hindi people.  Useless video even if you are good in skills.  Try to post english ☹️
Thanku soo much sir..<br>No one can teach like you

devta aadmi ho bhai aap
Agar Employee nuberka jo column hai ekme employee number hai aur dusare table me kuch alag name raha tho equi join kaise kare?
so HOW it is different from natural join?
Bahut badhiya Bahut Badhiya
select e.Ename from Employee e join Department d on e.Eno = d .Eno where e.address = d.location.
It&#39;s 2022 and he&#39;s still the best !!

Sir, My Name is Ravi and I am still waiting to get placed in some branch in your videos !!!
Its 2022 but he is still best
sir i have a question that  if we are comparing two different attributes like  dept.deptno=emp.ename  so it is going to give the data type mismatch error  isnt it?   or it will give the output. im a lttle bit confused.
thankyou sir for clearing our doubts nd to help us to understand the concept easily 😊
it&#39;s 2022 and still now ,no one is better than varun sir .<br>Thank you so much sir,it helps me a lot in my college exams .🙏
Inner join bhi same result deta he na?
we can directly write address = location not need of writing emp.addewss = dept.location <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUiPjkOQG9w&amp;t=13m51s"">13:51</a>

Good Tutorial
just got addicited to his classes which are aswome
Can we  write <br>Select E-name from emp natural join dept where emp.adress = dept.location  ?<br>As when we write natural join , there is no need write the condition :- <a href=""http://emp.no/"">Emp.no</a> = Dept.e_no
Sir ap run board me kra dete hai ye bhut accha lga🙏🙏🙏🙏💯
Amazing..Thanku Sir
very well explained sir. thank you :)
Thank u sir.
It&#39;s 2021, still best.
summary:<br><br>the difference between the natural join and the Equi join:<br><br>in natural join you are only allowd to check for equals, with the columns that are the same/ with the same name in both the tables<br><br>in equi join you are also additionally  allowed to check for equals, with columns that are not the same name. example here we were comparing the address field with the Department Location field.
Perfect professor ur... Really I like ur way of explanation without doubts.

Isme cross product hoga?
I saw many videos on joins but you are the only one who taught this well and I learnt it very well  HATS OFF to you....
Thank you bhaiya🙏🏽
thank u sir the videos are great
Sir there is one request.....Plz make videos on joins by using the tables.......along with the symbols of each kind of joins
Sir, in employee table  Dept_no is work as primary key so how it can be null? please explain me
4   Years for this vid and still cleared my doubt
If possible please give some ideas for relational joins equations.... with some examples....

Do you have video about Left Join with multiple tables in sql?
Sir jab left outer join sirf left table ka data deta hai toh aap dname  and loc kaise dikha rhe output mae
Hello, kya hum isme ek column dept_no. Ka add kr skte h ? Final table m
ur explanation is so user friendly and easy to follow, that&#39;s a sign of good teacher where candidates can follow with much ease. Funda any expert can give but instructions which can be conceptualise much easily by most audiences, gets counted <br>So I must recommend your ways of teaching...5 star from my side
Help me with the query to find top 5 customers who have placed maximum order in last 6 months. Assume 2 tables as customers and orders.
speechless sir🙏🙏
Mannnn u are great..thansk a lot
Nice
thanks sir .......<br>🥰
super....<br><br>bhaiya ... all concept clear
why you have not used  &quot;inner join&quot; syntax in your example.
Sir plz make video on &quot; join on &quot; or &quot; join using &quot;.
KIIT ka ladka hu sir
Finally ravi ko dept mil hi gya 😭😭
How do I decide when to use left or right join...
<b>One question, from employee means it will select columns which are in employee table but there is no D_name and loc in employee table. So, how can the server select these two columns if these are not present in this from employee table</b>
Why did you add loc in query?
awesome join tutorials sir...very helpful and deep explained
Shouldn&#39;t the primary key be unique and not null in all cases? In ur example the primary key dept no is not unique, it contains D1 value twice.
Why didnt we include dep no. In the table?
Sir please make a video on key difference between Equi join,Natural join and Inner join.Many students get confused with it ?
extraordinary and good teaching skills
Sir you said that in join cross product need to do. But in this video, you don&#39;t discuss about any cross product situation. Will you please help to understand ??
Are sir kya padate ho , maja aa gaya ❤
F U RAJA
Amazing explanation, in fewer words. Keep it up !
Excellent teaching.thank you si much
Sir, what happens when D1 appears thrice in table 2, what will be the output?
how we use all the join operation in relational algebra ..you use the sql command or syntax
When using an OUTER JOIN, you must explicitly state that you want either a LEFT JOIN or a RIGHT JOIN. (T/F)
VERY NICE EXPLANATION !!
Sir Jase inner join hai sir ap mujhe outer join ka syntax bta dy
Can we use &quot;where&quot; instead of &quot;on&quot; in the query 🤔
Sir, You are explaining everything clearly. Excellent teaching....
Sir you said that we will see the rows in the result which exist in left table and does not exist in right table but in the result the rows department name and location are belongs to right table na….
which language is this?
Please tell me<br>Is natural join &amp; inner join are same
Thankyou sir
I am from a non technical background and preparing for interview. I had a lot of confusion in SQL but after watching these videos my confusion is cleared. Thank you so much. 😊
Sir yah kesy pata chala ga Kai is query Mai natural join Nahi lagy ga left yah right lagy ga??
Hi, thanks for your videos, helped me alot. Are left OUTER join and left join similar??
you are great
Can you please tell me, if we have Table A with 6 rows  1 column and the data is &quot;1&quot; in every cell and it is same in Table B also so how many rows it will give in case of Left/Right Outer Join and in Inner Join also.
Can we use where in place of on
sir join me multiple table k liye join kese us kare plz sir mtlb 5 table hai jo ek dusre se link hojae vese
Sir humne yaha WHERE KI JAGAH ON KYO USE KIYA HAI??
-_-   WTF,.     You Mean in the OuterLeftJoin simply Left Table is the Output??
why dept. no is not printed in the output?
Sir ek cheej btaiya aapne kha left outer join equal to natural join + extra left, pr natural join m to hm condition likhte hi nhi h to hme left outer join m condition likhne ki jarurat nhi h <br>Pir bhi hm likhte h
i Love you SIR
to the point✌
Sir how to write D1,E3,S3.<br>Pls tell commands. I have tried but it won&#39;t came.
Simple. Left join (or) left outer join
Awesome work sir.. 🙏🏻
sir here why didn&#39;t you used WHERE for condition ?? Is this because you used oracle syntax...??
Thank you so much😊Sir please upload video on conditional join and full outer join
In natural and equi join we have used &#39;AND&#39; for connecting to table and here we have used &#39;ON&#39; why?
Finally Ravi ko department mil hi gaya😂🤣....<br><br>Next is Nitin 😝....
Sir jaha tak mughe pata h, jo apne final table banaya hai usme ek attribute missing h jo ki &quot;department no&quot; h. Ap ek bar concepts check kr k reply kro mughe.
I recwntly found your channel and loved your content . Really you are great teacher and your way of teachind with examples is mind blowing. Thank you so much for providing this to us for free

thanks sir  i get benifit to this video you teaching way  is easy to understand to everyone
<a href=""https://youtu.be/znx6ifkIQgY"">https://youtu.be/znx6ifkIQgY</a>
Excellent teaching skill. The way you have explained the join concept is awesome it becomes easy to understand.
summary:<br><br>left outer join gives the rows that are  matching, and the rows  that are in the left table but not in the right table.
and what emp.dept no is not equal to dept.deptno is it also give values of left table ( d4 is also present in the left table than what will happen) sir plz give ans
Ur a perfect explained... I love you for ur explanation and clear cut understanding without doubts..
Those people who dislike these videos they really don&#39;t know about computer science and they don&#39;t deserve to watch these videos
Thank you sir . You made it so easy to understand .
In the query, we are writing <del>-&gt; select ---from --</del> on<br>why are we using &quot;on&quot;, in the previous videos we used &quot;where&quot; instead of &quot;on&quot; ???????
Just one doubt ...... in left outer join you said matching rows should come
I had a confusion.. Like here you have mentioned &#39;left outer join&#39; in the query, can we also write &#39;equi join&#39; (in place of emp, dept) in the previous video?
you are no less than professor
your videos provide great and precise understanding of the topic. I would support you, if I had something useful for you
Can we use WHERE instead ON ?
the teaching is way different and more powerful as compare to many teachers
Finally, Ravi gets appointed to the IT department ... 🤣😂
YOu are GReat Sir!
Exellect sir.
Stunning video about Left out join, thanks for updating
sir dept no atrribute kaha giya sir???
thanks sir ap ne bht achy tareky se smjhaya, or sir Mera aik question hai wo ye k ager natural join wali condition full fill ni hoti to kya left table ka sara data return Hoga?????????
What can be the max observation in left outer join?
Very nicely explained. Thank you Sir
Sir isme cross product nhi hoga tables ka
Sir,don&#39;t we have to do. The cross. Product in this case
sir do we also need to write <a href=""http://dept.no/"">dept.no</a>. in output ?

Best Teaching 😊✌

U r the best teacher In  the universal
👍 😀 😊 🙏
I think it would be more appropriate if the the two outer joins conditions were &quot;or&quot; instead of &quot;and&quot;
sir isame where condition nhi chalti haii kya ? &#39;ON&#39; qualifier kyu lagaya jata haii please reply.
Finally i understood difference between right and left join
Sir how it is posdible that foreign key have different value than primary key e.g D4 in second table
sir D_name mai D1,D2,D3,D4 ki jgay  IT,HR,Finance,Testing aana chaye na
Sir please make a video on key difference between Equi join,Natural join and Inner join.Many students get confused with it ?
Sir aapke padhane ka tarika 1 no hai<br>Mera friend Rahul Sen to aapka fan ho gya
In output D-name is not D1 but it is IT and so on

HI SIR ...🙏🙏<br>is 🤔(EMP left outer join DEPT ) = (DEPT right outer join EMP )  ??
Hey Varun , what if we made E_no is primary key than it can&#39;t be null. So how we get the last row that is in right table.
When to use alias in joins?
Great great explanation thanks sir 🙏🏻
thank you sir
Thnx u ❤️very so much vaun sir.. 😊
Our faculty made it rocket science while explaining🥲
Thank you Sir.. Your videos is very helpful... Can you make videos on Full and inner outer join it is helpful for beginners
Thank you
if d5 in emp table then, will it count on output
where is Full Outer Join Video?
Dname ki jagah dno written
Sir humne dept table m d4 ki values ku likhi hui h agar vo emp table m nhi h toh? Emp table is the base table right? Kuki agar vo employee h hi nhi toh uska data dept table m kese aya? Or am i missing something?
great value sir!!
Can we write only Right Join instead of Right Outer Join?

Excellent teaching bro...Helped a lot
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7J__TGqoQs&amp;t=6m34s"">6:34</a> when we are considering emp_no. As a Primary key then how could it be null/void?
This playlist is best for DBMS in whole YouTube platform.
No words to explain how we are thankful to u sir . Your tutorials are best 👌 👍
I think sir is table me kuch galti huva hay..
Hello sir,<br>I think in query we have to write dept right outer join emp,not emp right outer join department. Can someone verify this one?
Thanks sir u made very good videos
sir, can you please explain me when i should use one of those join i am confused
Very well explained…. Thank u so much sir

very good
Good Tutorial.
Your dedication❤..thank you so much sir..join concept is clear now.
thank you for the course sir
what is the difference between Natural Join and inner join..?
<a href=""http://emp.no/"">Emp.no</a> is primary key ,to isme null value nahi daal sakte na?
I have one ❓ please tomorrow is my ppr kindly someone answer<br>If the primary key of right table is not present as and foreign key in the left table but the primary key of left table is present as an foreign key in the right table then it will perform right outter join operation by looking on by looking on  that foreign key or not 🚫
Awesome video sir
you are great teacher indeed
If this man wasn’t here to teach i bet I won’t be here❤️
<a href=""https://youtu.be/5FsIa4Mp3ho"">https://youtu.be/5FsIa4Mp3ho</a>
What is the attributes where you added Null are actually having Not Null constraint.?
sir what happens if two Employees work in same department<br>Then we need to add two rows of same same department, Am I right
great explanation man. Keep going
In Dept table if we replace Dept_No attribute to D_no and then we apply condition i.e<br>On(emp.Dept_no=Dept.D_no)<br>Then it is valid or not?
Please do a video on join in relational algebra
Easy flow concept sir😋
Mind blowing
Can anyone plz confirm , here Emp will be the refrencing table right ? as all foreign key values are taken from primary key and deletion of values from the p.k of refrenced table should delete or put null at the refrencing table
God bless you sir and mam and your daughter.... Mwahhh
Right join and full outer join 😊😊🙏 thank you 😊
varun sir i am watching your video since last year .Today,finally I got to know u are faculty at lpu .Hope to meet you soon sir.
at d_name y written wrong
You&#39;re such an excellent professor 🙏🏻...glad I found Ur playlist...seems like a saviour
Sir here you write for display dept_name (IT,HR) but you write  dept_no.
good work sir
So, in Left and right Outer Join, there is no cross product of the two tables? <br>Just two conditions right ?
Why did you write dep_no instead of d_name in the output?
Good explanation sir.... 😘😘"

It is important to specify that the language of instruction is not English. The title does not indicate that the language of instruction is non-english. This is click bait title.
This isn&#39;t english is it?

In both the tables, sirf column names same hone se hoga yaa fir column ka contents bhi same hona padega?

It can also be done by - <br>pi((student) - (employee))<br><br>Right?
Sir,gate ke liye questions kaha se lagaye?
Sir can we also write like this( π name(Student-Employee) )??
Excellent
Thanku sir 🥰
Sir, it&#39;s possible ki 2 different persons have same name, toh last wali query fail ho jati hai ki dono tables se name project krlo...<br>Toh usme we need one more attribute that is primary key and available in both tables to distinguish 2 person having same name
sir can we write as      π name ( (student) - (employee) )

Sir In the second question in examples. Do we need to write p.pname or pname is enough?  Because In the first example we took s.sname to select the supplier name right.

Sir i have a doubt as at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnsrohgiPo0&amp;t=6m53s"">6:53</a> you explained the unsafe expression that table is supplier table then must be their all name present is of supplier and when we put name not supplier then it will print nothing. And not fall in infinite loop . Where i am getting wrong can you please once clear this.

Thanks sir Allah blessing you ❤️
Good job sir
You should have mentioned in the title that this tutorial is theory only, I wasted my time on your 4 videos and then realized that there is no practical explanation on your videos. How will someone new will learn from these videos and most surprising things is all the comments in videos are positive. I am wondering that are they that brilliant that they learn SQL from your theoretical videos only or may be you have deleted the negative comments   .
This is amazing or awesome youtube channel for computer science and technology or coding language or programming language 🙏🙏 I also want to started teeching about this topic. Nobody don&#39;t miss any video from this channel<br>Maine bhe sql basic yahi se padha tha
sir can you give us notes?
sir you are awesome teacher
Are SQL and  my SQL both are same..🤔

Lots of thanks brother 💗
Actually I have purchased a paid course but they r not able to teach this topics properly....They have very good knowledge but teaching is a art ...U r best ... Don&#39;t stop unloading videos
This comment is for all new visitors trying to find a quality tutorial to learn SQL.<br>Mostly free and crash courses teaches you basics and start without introducing any terminologies and the agenda behind the course is to show the instructors&#39; skills and knowledge so you can go and enroll in their Paid Course. Now as far as this course is concerned It is one of the most brilliant Free course you can find on YouTube. The instructor explains exquisitely well, covers so many topics, I doubt any other tutorial covered that many, Just Superb. <br>This guy deserves more than just a like.<br>Thank you so much Sir, May Allah bless you with the best of His guidance.
is the playlist completed?
Sir I am covering it for my term 2 exam ...Can go ahead with this vdo?

One of the best teacher I have ever found in internet.
Sir I&#39;ve an idea:<br>While i was watching your video was facing too many ads. And got distracted, is it possible if any student is watching educational videos on YouTube then they will only get ads up to motivation commercials and not swiggy, chocolates, movie trailers.. etc etc because it is too  easy to get distracted through these ads if I&#39;ll get motivating ads from yt in middle of lectures that&#39;d be great 🤔

Hey i have a doubt , you have told earlier that we will  use semi colon in the last sentence only but when u have shown the implementation , u have given semi colon after each command after create table , then alter table add column command and then drop column command also . <br><br>Could u please specify the use of semi colons again and again ?<br><br>Also please clarify the use of brackets in the syntax of the commands and not using the same brackets in  the actual command when we write . How so ? Those brackets thing is really confusing me

Log is generated so we can ROLLBACK to some previous state<br><br>Truncate :- <br>i. All the Tuples are deleted at one go<br>ii. Use of WHERE clause is not allowed<br>iii. Fast<br>iv . No Log is generated

When Empid should not b null as it is a primary key already but when we use right outer join then if no matching with  that respective Empid in that place we see null right so is that breaking the primary key constraint? Can anyone Clear my doubt
Thank you so much sir ❤

Thank you thank you thanks you soooo muchh i can&#39;t explain how greatful I&#39;m for this video you explanation made me learnt this easily tomorrow is my 11th grade annual exam I was so stressed now I am relief thanks again you gained a new subscriber❤
I really see your effort and your hard work in teaching the full DBMS and SQL tutorial but one thing I see missing here is the practical application of these concepts. It would have been better if you could teach us practically and we can practice along with it.
Very easily explained, noice

the marker drop was key
can i use select e_name from emp order by salary desc limit 1;<br>or   select e_name,max(salary) from emp;
helpful sir
Ansh
Thank you Sir❤❤
Thanks a lot❤❤❤
sir krdiya subscribe bhut jarruri tha meri zindgi se bhi zyada thanku love u
i am confuse, ham kaise smje hame kb subquery lagana hai
Varun sir is like a typical friend 😂.  Hmesha apne friends ka naam likho example table me, and apni salarybsbse maximum 😂😂
❤❤❤
SELECT E_name, salary FROM Emp WHERE salary =(select max (salary) from Emp);
Instead od using a Sub query... Why can i just write  &quot;Where salary = Max(salary);&quot;
Supplier <br>(id, name, city)<br>Parts (pno, pname, prescription)<br>Supply (id, pno, cost)<br>(i) Find the names of the parts supplied by “Rahul”<br>Please answer it
Select ename from emp where salary in(select max(salary) from emp;   yahan pe in bhi likh sakte hai naaa??
how do yall put english tittle then indian language in the video? yall suck.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yog7h4BokQ&amp;t=4m55s"">4:55</a> why we can&#39;t write like this:<br>select employ_name, max(salary)<br>from employ<br>OR<br>select employ_name<br>from employ<br>where max(salary)
Can the solution of question 2 be : Select e_name,max(salary) from employee? If not ,why?
Can the solution of question 2 be : Select e_name,max(salary) from employee? If not ,why?
What if the salary is same for 2 persons.. whose name wil be displayed if two employees have 50000
aggregate function ka video kyu nahi mil raha
Nice
Hii. Varun <br>I am preparing for my SQL interview and your lectures is really very easy to understand. keep it up.<br>Thanks a lot.
Sir your SQL lectures are extraordinary, ❤from Pakistan.
alter command ke baad wale lectures kaha h ?
Omp sir🙏❣️
We can also do SELECT E_name,max(salary) FROM student
really informative videos. your playlists helped<br> me a lot in different courses
Thanks for video.<br>One correction at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yog7h4BokQ&amp;t=5m36s"">5:36</a>, subquery will execute for all the rows present in table.<br>So if there are 10 records in a table then inner query will compute the result every time and comparison will happen with that value for the given row.  SO total 10 times inner query also would run.
Thank you sir your teaching  is understanding
Videos are really helpful. I cannot find video DML (select, insert, update &amp; delete). Please help.
Thank you , ye wala lecture mujhe pasand aya
bhai citna bada video bahi rahe toh practical bhi bata diya karo
👍 😀 😊 🙏
Why I use here subqueries, could you tell some difference.
Sir, I have gotten same result without subqueries<br>SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1;
Thank You sir
select max(salary),E_name from employees; <br>can this query be written like this? Correct me if I&#39;m  wrong :)
I LEARNED LOT FROM HERE🤗
Maine sir apke 15 subscriber badwa diye you are great sir

SIR AAPKI PEN GIR GYI
Nice way we understand every things
None of your videos are organised in this playlist. To watch a video I have to go to multiple videos of diffferent channels or yours channel. Also you&#39;ve skipped many topics which also a major problem for someone who is studying DBMS first time.
Other countries this topic teach to 10 class and in our country this topic teach to BS students 🤔
Thnkuu so much sir🥰
But If I want to print all table details with new columns- MAx(salary) with GROUP BY and If I write<br>SELECT E_ID, E_Name ,DeptNo, salary, MAX(Salary) as Max_Salary <br>FROM EMP<br>GROUP BY DeptNo;<br>--It will show error that E_ID is not aggregate function. Then how to resolve this
nice
kya hum inner query mai aur query pass kar sakte hai ?
Can we write below query for your question.<br><br>Select ename, max(salary ) from employee..
Sir can I also write Select Emp. name, Max(Marks) from Emp;
Thanku sir
RAJA PAK
Thanks a lot for so informative series.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yog7h4BokQ&amp;t=3m55s"">3:55</a> sir kuch ziada hi jazbati ho gae xD
But sir for comparison  we use == this sign .<br>And u used only single equal to operator=
clean explanation
Thnk u
mera suggestion yahi rahega guru ji ki agar yeah sab queries jo aap likhkar samjha rahe hai agar practical ho jata to kya maza aa jata ......But still amazing lecture.
can we wrote SELECT EMP_NAME , MAX(SALARY) AS MAX_SAL FROM EMPLOYEE IN QUE2 ?
The way you teach is awesome! Really apricated 👍
tomorrow is ma paper
hello sir but the query for 2nd question can also be this<br><br>SELECT e_name from Employee ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT 1;<br><br><br>Please anybody reply and save whether i am correct or not
thank you so much dear sir!<br>I am watching your videos from Afghansitan and I have got a lot expierance from your lecture so go ahead and we will keep you on prayer so keep it up .<br>I have never seen a teacher like you so again I really appritiated you sir
Sir please explain query to select all data .<br>But the problem is that we have to select the data from 6 different drop down list (select tag) and if the user selects any two or three lists, the sql command should return only the row which have atleast these three list data in single row<br>But if user specify all six list data then the query should return complete requested data in any row.
Thankyou sir

Thank you sir,<br>Very nice explanation 🙂
you are the best teacher to me.. thanks sir
Sir, yeh vala query run kara but query run nai hora <br>select E_name from employee<br>where salary = (select max(salary) from employee<br>where salary &lt;&gt;(select max(salary) from employee)
What a brilliant method of teaching ❤❤❤
In scenarios where we are aware of the highest salary (e.g., $50,000) and wish to retrieve the second-highest value, the SQL query provided in this video is suitable. However, in real-world situations where we do not possess prior knowledge of the highest salary and need to obtain it dynamically, we can employ the following query:<br><br>SELECT name<br>FROM emp<br>WHERE salary = (SELECT DISTINCT MAX(salary) FROM emp WHERE salary &lt; (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp));
You are an excellent trainer!
the first question can be easily done using -<br><br>SELECT DISTINCT Salary<br>FROM Employee<br>ORDER BY Salary DESC<br>LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;<br>//the OFFSET function will help to skip the first row and return the second highest result
Thankyou sir.🙏🙏🙏🌹🌷
i usually dont comment . but your hardwork , determination and quality content forced me to comment .<br>after all i thank you for making this whole playlist.
Sir if 2 times or 3 times or so on 40000 arrive than what happen does it check the rest of the tuples?
No one can be compared with Varun  Sir ... he is a unique key teacher❤
You are the best Teacher in CS faculty of programming side , thank you so much for helping people.
It would be better if the explanation is in English;but I can say that he is definitely one of the best youtube teachers for SQL.
Thankyou so much sir for making it so easy!
Excellent sir♥️♥️♥️♥️
zaddy💖💖
Great sir and you brilliant person
Very nice explanation and clear 👏👏👌
No one teaches like you , ❤
select e_name from employee where salary = (select salary from employee where e_id = (select count(e_id) from employee)-(2-1) order by salary);
Nice
Thank you for english sub
He is incredible and so inspirational. i got a full clarity on the query, no one can explain like you sir, lecture is simple and crystal clear.
sir you are a godlike teacher for me
get smashers, Neso academy, jennys lecture, education for u , 5  mins engineering, Dr.gajendra Purohit all these are my teachers of my 4 years btech course.
Your explanation is very nice
I need 3rd highest salary in emp table and who is name
SELECT E_name FROM EMP<br>WHERE Salary=(SELECT min(Salary) FROM EMP<br>WHERE Salary IN (SELECT Salary FROM EMP<br>ORDER BY Salary DESC<br>LIMIT 2))<br><br>Is it applicable?
teacher ho to aise
Very thanks sir
Soooopper sir
sir your teaching is too good clearning concept in dept can i join your class. help me how can i join our class
If we use order by to salary in descending order and keep condition has  limit 2 it will be the same output right
for 2nd question instead of writing 3 queries we can solve it using L Imit function <br><br>select  *  from customers <br>where points &lt; (select max(points)from customers) <br>order by points desc <br>limit 1
👍 😀 😊 🙏
Sir second highest salary me hum 1st maximum salary ko delete krde us ke baad hum maximum nikale to 40000 aayega... This way will be accepted or not please tell me..
Thank you so much sir bhut bda doubt clear kr dia apne thank you so much 🙏
But isn&#39;t that query inefficient? I mean what if we want 3rd or 4th highest salary. Then that would increase the number of sub queries right? Instead you can write this query: select name from employee order by salary desc offset 1 limit 1;
Your work is God level work.hats off sir
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lLpe_detTY&amp;t=8m25s"">8:25</a> sir agar SELECT Emp_name ki jagah SELECT * kiya jatah to Keya change hota? <br>Please answer dedo Varun sir🙏
Sir, in highest query 50000 can be multiple times, lets say all are having 50000 so in that it will not give any answer but second highest in that we can say 50000 ?
The way you teach is marvelous and explaining the concepts in a simpler manner is your innate ability, God Bless :)
you are good teacher
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lLpe_detTY&amp;t=6m13s"">6:13</a> sir alter command se truncate ya delete karke 50000 wali row ko then max salary wala nhi laga sakte kya 😊
SELECT Max(salary)<br>FROM emp<br>where salary&lt;&gt;50000;<br>this also works
Sir can we write this queries in this way or not<br><br>1. select * from employ <br>     order by salary  desc<br>     order by 1,1;<br><br>2. . select e_name from employ <br>     order by salary  desc<br>     order by 1,1;
This is very old method to display second maximum sal instead of this we can just use select max(sal) form emp where sal&lt;(select max (sal) from emp;
Great learning, You are simply the best💙
u r amazing bro! hats off to u . i m watching ur video,pls let me know how can i attend ur live class. thanks
awesome sir
Select Max(Salary) from Employee  order by Salary offset 1 limit 1 ;<br><br>I wrote this for question 1
maximum salary wali row ko delete karke bhi to second heighest aa jayegi easily
2D query and 3D query
Alternate Sol.:<br><br>select max(salary) from emp where salary &lt; (select max(salary) from emp);<br><br>to get name:<br><br>with cte1 as<br>(<br>select name,max(salary) as max_salary from emp group by name<br>)<br>,cte2 as<br>(<br>select max(max_salary) as 2nd_max_salary from cte1<br>)<br>,cte3 as<br>(<br>select name,max_salary from cte1 where (max_salary) in (select 2nd_max_salary from cte2<br>)<br>select * from cte3;
Sir, I just want to ask if there are so many values in the table and if we are asking for some random value like &quot;20th Highest salary&quot; or anything like that, so can you please let me know syntax for this.
But aggregate function can not be used with where clause ...
Everywhere we can find saints in many forms. You are also a saint who teaching with very skilled. Amazing man. You are very smart looking teacher who speak like a charm.

The best video for solving all types of questions related to Sub queries..
I am seeing this video in the era of ChatGPT where it gave me the exact same answer as yours but then i told it use sub-query / nested query  instead and the reply it gave twisted me from top to bottom &quot;<br>SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS num_employees<br>FROM employee<br>GROUP BY dept<br>HAVING num_employees = (SELECT MAX(num_employees) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_employees FROM employee GROUP BY dept) AS dept_counts);<br>&quot;

Why can&#39;t we write e name in place of dept in ?
thanks sir..
Sir i think we should write count* along with dept too
Can we use = instead of in in this query?
How do i get the maximum employees from the group by Dept; ....please can anyone help me??😢😢
Can we replace In with =?

Thanks arigato
Awesome sir thank you🙏
Vese to be very honest agar gate ke liye prep kara hota to apse hi kata paid course kharid ke

why not equals to instea of IN?
Couldnt it be just like: Select E_name, Dept, from Emp Group by Dept Having Count (*) &lt; 2
Nice
Sir isse phle vale me aapne count * q liya tha
Can we use dept = instead of dept In?
sir has a good collection of T-shirts🙃
if we use dept =   except dept in, is it ok?
Sir can I use dept= instead of dept In
we can also write like select dept , count(*) as count_emp from employee group by dept heving  count_emp&lt;2;
Sir mene video pause krke apne se ek query banayi h <br>select dept from (select dept, count(*) as c from emp group by dept) where c &lt; 2;<br>Ye query sahi h kya??
Thank you sir❤
Your Query is correct BUT leading in incorrect way as question was  get dept name where EMP ARE LESS THAN 1..So you should have used e_name/e_id in group by cause..it would have given more justice to question
Thanks sir
Sir what about this query <br>Select dept, count(*) from emp group by dept having count(*) &lt;2;
Thankuuh sir ✨
In Inner Query, why don&#39;t we take select dept, count(dept) ......  as took it in the last video.
Thank you so much Varun sir <br>1.Gate + 2.Infosys training aapka material hi use kr rha hu<br>🙏🙏🙏

Thank you so much Sir..<br>Nice presentation.
sir thanks for this playlist..it is a huge help for a guy from non cs,it stream
Happy teacher&#39;s day sir
You r the best teacher ever learnt @gatesmasher💯💯🔥❣️
Sir i have a question ( nested queries and subqueries) are same thing?<br><br>And one more thing your teaching skills are ufff🌋!
Can&#39;t we use dept = rather than IN ??
tbh, i had no idea regarding &#39;having&#39; clause and finally came across ur video. i didn&#39;t have to watch it over and over. never seen a teaching so clear and precise. u r the best! thank you sir
Sir count value not add
Brother You are doing great job, keep it up...... Lots of love From Pakistan
Understood the query very easily 💯.
very nice
Easy way of second query is <br><br>SELECT E_NAME, DEPT FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPT HAVING COUNT(DEPT)&lt;2;
Note --you can use Department instead of *<br>Count ( department )..
Gate smashed always saves me <br>Thanks to a true teacher in this age of fitna
@gate smashers <br>Jis table mein group by ka use kar rahe ho aap uss table mein hr, mrkt ye values repeat ,so table isn&#39;t normalised. <br>Isse ye pata chalta h na ki table mein group by ka use tavi hoga jab kisi column mein values repeat honge.<br> Hai na?<br>Plz reply sir.
Thanx sir 💗💗
Great Sir agr sb teacher ap jaisa teach kren tw bht intelligent students ho jain , great sir thank you so much 💗
awesoooooooooom<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
Sir,<br>Can we use = in place of in ?
In is used instead of =
Excellent explanation sir I just loved watching your video 👌
Thanku sir
Sir agar hum cout(*)&lt;2 pehele he laga dete jaise last wali video m kiya tha to thik hota kya
Thank you sir for your <a href=""http://class.it/"">class.it</a> was very understandable your class was very nice ❤️
sir can we use e_name in the place of dept ,to print employee name without using nested queries?
Thnkew
Sir practically pn dakahava
Having count(dept)&lt;2 ;
Sir you are best teacher
All the video  lectures is  clearly understand  and  clear all my  doubt.
select e_name from practice where dept IN (select dept, count(dept) from practice GROUP by dept HAVING count(*)&lt;2);<br>&quot;too many values&quot; aise error aa rahi hai.
select dept., count* from emp.<br>group by dept.<br>having count *&lt;2
Sir can we use &quot;=&quot; in place of &quot;In&quot;? <br>Select e_name from emp where dpt &quot; = &quot; (Select dpt from emp group by dpt having count(*) &lt;2) ;
Great job 👍 amazing teacher
You&#39;re life saviour. I watch your videos  just before exam. And my exam goes good
I like DBMS because of you, well explained sir all
Very nice explanation, thank you so much for creating this video, I have subscribed your channel and click on the bell icon as well. The way you teach is awesome.
If I write --&gt;<br>Select count(dept) from emp group by dept having count(dept) &lt;2 ---&gt;<br>Can it give &quot;IT&quot; as output
Understood very nicely 👍👍
Sir can we use&#39; =&#39; instead of in
Thanq sir. I saw many videos on this topic I confused more one after another video.. U made it very very clear even I know very small  hindi.. Ur teaching is best option for beginners especially... Keep going sir...
Hello everyone
than yuo, teacher
for god sake put hindi in title
So much interesting sir
Sir, for printing name of employee who is the only one working in dept.. <br>Can we write.. <br>SELECT E_name FROM Emp GROUP BY dept HAVING COUNT(*) &lt; 2;<br>As the Query <br>SELECT dept FROM Emp GROUP BY dept HAVING COUNT(*) &lt; 2; <br>will print only the name of dept having one employee I think instead of writing dept if we write E_name then it can print Employee name. <br>Thank you.
Brother, &quot; YOU ARE BORN TO TEACH&quot;.
Greatfull to you sir💕💕"

Actually may be this command will give wrong output , because if highest salary of one department can be lower salary of other department ,then it will return both lower and higher salary of that department .
What if we have two tables separately, in which one table contain employee salary, name then other table contain department name and common attribute is dno
hats off!
what if salary is not distinct and is repeated in the table. Then this will give wrong answer
This is the right query. This will give you the name, salary, and department of the employees who earn the most in each department. If there are multiple employees in the same department with the same highest salary, they will all be included in the result.<br><br><br>SELECT e.first_name, e.salary, d.department_name<br><br>FROM employees e<br>JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id<br>WHERE (e.department_id, e.salary) IN (<br>    SELECT department_id, MAX(salary)<br>    FROM employees<br>    GROUP BY department_id<br>);
Inner Join is must
hats offff u sir
query is wrong we need to add dept also otherwise it will display only names and no department corresponding to that
This query is taking error…
SELECT max(salary),e_name from emp GROUP by dept;     can we write this ??
Hello Varun. First, thanks for creating these videos. Now, kindly tell us a query where we can display the name of employees drawing hishest salary, Dept name and salary simultaneously in a single query. Thanks bro.
I think its wrong as it may give the details of those employees who dont have max salary in their own dept but their salary matches with the max salary of another dept<br>Appropriate Query should be something like:<br>SELECT E1.*<br>FROM Employee AS E1<br>INNER JOIN (<br>  SELECT Dept, MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary<br>  FROM Employee<br>  GROUP BY Dept<br>) AS E2<br>ON E1.Dept = E2.Dept AND E1.Salary = E2.MaxSalary;
This should be the correct query (tested) - <br><br>SELECT E_NAME, SALARY <br>FROM EMP<br>WHERE SALARY IN<br>(<br>    SELECT MAX(SALARY)<br>    FROM EMP<br>    GROUP BY DEPT<br>);
Nice
I am getting getting answer through select ename, max(salary) from employee group by  dpt;
Let say there are two departments x and y now x department highest salary is 4000 and y department highest salary is 3000 but there may be some case where department in x have someone&#39;s salary 3000 so while printing 3000 will be compared to each row of the inner query and comes true <br><br>Here is example <br>id  | name | country | course | salary<br>(1, &#39;Alice&#39;, &#39;USA&#39;, &#39;Math&#39;, 6000),<br>(2, &#39;Bob&#39;, &#39;Canada&#39;, &#39;OOPS&#39;, 2000),<br>(3, &#39;Carol&#39;, &#39;UK&#39;, &#39;History&#39;, 3000),<br>(4, &#39;garvit&#39;, &#39;India&#39;, &#39;OOPS&#39;, 5000),<br>(5, &#39;himanshu&#39;, &#39;Jimba&#39;, &#39;CSA&#39;, 5000),<br>(6, &#39;Nishant&#39;, &#39;Turkey&#39;, &#39;Math&#39;, 6000),<br>(7, &#39;gauransh&#39;, &#39;zimbi&#39;, &#39;History&#39;, 7000),<br>(8, &#39;gitanshu&#39;, &#39;africa&#39;, &#39;CSA&#39;, 8000);<br><br><br>This is the data use course column as department which is explained in the videos perform group on course department <br><br>Here is the table creation code <br><br>CREATE TABLE `students` (<br>  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,<br>  `name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,<br>  `country` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,<br>  `course` varchar(20) NOT NULL,<br>  `salary` int(20) NOT NULL<br>) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COLLATE=latin1_swedish_ci;<br><br><br>INSERT INTO `students` (`id`, `name`, `country`, `course`, `salary`) VALUES<br>(1, &#39;Alice&#39;, &#39;USA&#39;, &#39;Math&#39;, 6000),<br>(2, &#39;Bob&#39;, &#39;Canada&#39;, &#39;OOPS&#39;, 2000),<br>(3, &#39;Carol&#39;, &#39;UK&#39;, &#39;History&#39;, 3000),<br>(4, &#39;garvit&#39;, &#39;India&#39;, &#39;OOPS&#39;, 5000),<br>(5, &#39;himanshu&#39;, &#39;Jimba&#39;, &#39;CSA&#39;, 5000),<br>(6, &#39;Nishant&#39;, &#39;Turkey&#39;, &#39;Math&#39;, 6000),<br>(7, &#39;gauransh&#39;, &#39;zimbi&#39;, &#39;History&#39;, 7000),<br>(8, &#39;gitanshu&#39;, &#39;africa&#39;, &#39;CSA&#39;, 8000);<br><br><br>ALTER TABLE `students`<br>  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`);<br><br><br>ALTER TABLE `students`<br>  MODIFY `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=9;<br>COMMIT;<br><br><br><br>THE OUTPUT IS GIVING 2 times CSA course with salary 5000 and 8000
Sir your quary is only showing the names who are taking Max salary.<br>But as per your question it should be shown highest salary, dept, and E name.<br>(Tasted in Microsoft SQL server)
What if 2 employees have same salary.. Then the above query will not work na?
Pura sahi nhi lg rha 😑😑😑😑
Overall you are going great but I see the query is not correct. It will fail e.g. if the MRKT is having anyone having 30K salary.
I think u have done a mistake in outer query where u are only compare the salary but in other department the salary may be the same but not maximum,like the max salary in hr is 20000 and if we compare this with salary and in department it any emp salary can be 20000.
sir a question can we usee in instead of = everywhere?
Ans is : select e_name , dept , salary from emp where (dept,salary) in (select dept,max(salary) from emp group by dept);
Dept should be there in the select of subqurey because group by attribute should be included in select...
It is not correct
Your videos on sql are really the ones which can clear the doubts of any person on this particular topic. thanks sir!
Sir, what will happen if a person earning 30k in Mrkt department?
Fire ho app🔥🔥
This query is wrong. This will print the names of all employee whose salary will match 30000,40000 or 50000. This query is similar to --&gt; select e_name where salary in (30000,40000,50000)
great explaination
select ename from emp where (dep,salary) IN(  select dep,MAX(salary) from emp GROUP BY dep );
thanks gate smashers
Inner the flow of your videos we are forgotten to like your videos the videos 😅😅😅
what if there is one more row with dept IT and person having 1000 salary ... it will aslo get printed ryt ? so it says that the query is wrong !!
Somthing wrong sir<br>If imp I&#39;d 2 taking 30000 salary then result=????
Outstanding work thank you 🙏
Dear Sir, I think the query will give wrong output if Ram which is in HR department has salary 50k and Ravi which is also in HR department has salary 60k rest of the entries remain same then the resulting output will be wrong as filtering will be done based on IN operator which will give you output with Ram and Ravi which is wrong so appropriate solution will be by taking join or by subquery with where condition inside subquery.  Correct me if I am wrong.
Thanku sir
The Correct query is :<br>Select Fname, Salary from employee where (Dno, Salary) In (Select Dno, Max(Salary) from employee group by Dno);<br>Explaination :-<br>the the inner query will give us the pairs , now outer query will take that pairs and will check if(Dno==Dno &amp;&amp; Salary==Salary) and then will give us the output
1 doubt only remaining that can&#39;t we use where clause when we use group by clause ?
what If Two department emp salary amount is same? than which name was print in
Select dept,max(salary),ename from employee group by dept,salary;   query likh sakte hai kya
The right query is <br><br>select e_name from emp <br>where (dept,salary) in (select dept,max(salary) from emp group by dept);
We can use order by if we are not using sub queries
Kya hum ese ni likh skte<br>Select E_name, Max(Salary) from Emp group by dept;
If in same department more than one employees take maximum Salary then how can we display all emp name having maximum Salary??
Sir can we write like this<br>Select ename, max (salary) from emp where dept in (select dept group by dept) order by salary
this is wrong query because two employee from different department can have same  salary for example in video examplem what if  amriti too have 30000 salary then he will also get print .
Query for second highest salary in each department..
BHAI MAI APKEY VIDEOS HAMESHSA FOLLOW KARTHA HU AND I LIKE THE WAY U TEACH US  I HAVE LIL DOUBT WHILE IM APPLYING  TO GET NAME OF EMP ITS SHOWING SYNTAX ERORR HOPE U WILL SEE MY COMMENT LOVE U BRO FROM ANDHRA PRADESH❤
thank you sir given explantion sub query.

Wrong query.
what if max sal of two dept are equal <br>what is the output of the drived querie
The correct query should be (tested):<br>Select Ename, Salary from Emp where (Dept, Salary) In (Select Dept, Max(Salary) from Emp group by Dept);

<a href=""https://youtu.be/QTaiF8N6i3Y"">https://youtu.be/QTaiF8N6i3Y</a>
is this right?<br>select e_name ,salary from emp group by dept having max(salary)
select ename,Dept,salary from emp group by Dept having max(salary);<br><br><br>y this is wrong ?
if someone is taking  10k in other dept too ........i think department wise comparison should also be done sir
Sir inner quairy why u removed dept
Here I think , department and salary columns should be added in where and then we can department wise highest salary or else result will have repeatative department wise salary.<br><br><br>Select * from emp where ( dept , salary) in (select dept , max( salary) from emp group by dept )
here cant we use having clause instead of where clause?
Wrong solution in case of repeated salary values
i solved this question without seeing
SELECT Ename , Max(Salary) FROM Emp<br>GROUP BY Dept<br><br>- This will do the work -
this will not work, suppose there is someone from IT with 40000/30000 salary, then this will  print that too. it is compulsory to check dept name too.
My approch was-<br>Select dept, salary<br>From employee<br>Group by dept having max(salary)
Best vedio ever seen everything is cleared in sql.Thank you Sir.
sir what will happen if one more tuple is there in employee table whose salary is 40,000 and department is IT.this query will print that name also
SELECT name, dept, max(salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY dept;
I think the appropriate query would be this:<br>select E_name from emp where (dept,salary) in (select dept ,max(salary) from emp group by dept);
love u sir u are great like me ...b/c u were creating video  i am following sequence now, i am at video number 62..
What if Amrit salary is 30000 then it will overlap with HR max salary?
The query is not proper for the question <br><br>please use this instead <br><br>Select ename,dept, salary<br>From emp<br>where (dept , salary) IN<br>         (Select dept, max(salary)<br>          From emp<br>          Group by dept );

query will give wrong answers on duplicate salary values . please provide correct query
Sir, I have a doubt<br>What if there is another tuple in the table with data : E_id = 5, E_name = Mohan, Dept = IT, Salary = 40000<br>then the person Mohan will also be in OUTPUT?<br>Please, comment on this.
my version of query:<br>select a.ename, a.salary from emp as a, (select dept as dept, max(salary) as salary from emp group by dept) as b where a.dept = b.dept and a.salary = b.salary;
what is the difference between union all and join..
correct me if im wroung im righting this query expectinf there is reduntant data in salary :<br>select e_name from emp where salery in(select max(salary from group by dept) and where dept in (select dept from group by dept)
As per question answer should be:: <br>select PERSON_NAME,DEP_ID,sal from employee where (DEP_ID,sal) in (select DEP_ID,max(sal) from employee group by DEP_ID);
The right answer for this is<br>Select e_name , dept, salary from emp<br>where (dept, salary) IN<br>(Select dept, Max(salary) from emp GROUP BY dept) ;
Can we  display  both col name with single select statement???
sir i think you forgot to teach insert command.......please cover it
can anyone help me to get the same query for second highest salary
You are the best ❤️😌
Select emp name where salary in (Select max(salary) , department from emp group by department id)
Select emp name where salary = (Select max(salary) , department from emp group by department id)
I used &#39;JOIN&#39; to get the desired output instead of nested query - not sure how nested query works here.<br><br>-- create a table<br>CREATE TABLE students (<br>  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,<br>  name TEXT NOT NULL,<br>  dept TEXT NOT NULL,<br>  salary INT not null<br>);<br>-- insert some values<br>INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, &#39;Ryan&#39;, &#39;IT&#39;, 10000),(2, &#39;Joanna&#39;, &#39;MRKT&#39;, 20000),<br>(3, &#39;Ravi&#39;, &#39;HR&#39;, 30000), (4, &#39;Nitin&#39;, &#39;MRKT&#39;, 40000), (5, &#39;Varun&#39;, &#39;IT&#39;, 50000),<br>(6, &#39;Shivam&#39;, &#39;MRKT&#39;, 30000);<br>-- fetch some values<br>Select <a href=""http://s.name/"">S.name</a>, S.dept, S.salary<br>From students as S<br>JOIN (Select dept, max(salary) as salary From students Group by dept) as T<br>on S.dept = T.dept<br>and S.salary =T.salary;
bhaiya agar sub query me dept bhi add krre hai to run nhi hora , too many values ara , why?
this query doesn&#39;t work if any other dept person having same salary as max of any other dept .
This query will work :<br>select Distinct e_name,dept,salary from emp where (dept , salary) in (select dept,max(salary) from emp group by dept);
I think this solution is Partially right only becoz if an employee from a department is taking minimum salary in that department but that salary is maximum in some other department then his name will be printed which is wrong.
code ma bohut mistake ha like.., agar multiple person having same salary ....
What if two department have same salary ,so can we write query like this<br><br>Select e_name from emp where dept In(select dept max(salary)from emp group by dept);"

THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR EXPLAINING IN SUCH GOOD WAY SIR ,,,,,
Love from Pakistan
Way of explaining is very good
Sir ap ki teaching itni kmal hh mushkl mushkl topic mintooo main cover ho jay
Great 🎉❤
Bohot hi badhiya aur easy lang me seekhate ho aap sir. Thankyou once again!
Can we use natural join here instead of using IN?
Amazing Sir. Im from non coding background but im picking up things so easily from your videos.
sir, please clear my doubt!!! in this problem, can we use JOIN in place of IN?
in this question  we can use intersect as well
Is question ko join queries se v to solve kar sakte hai
One more solution :-<br><br>SELECT e_name FROM emp2, project where emp2.e_id = project.e_id;
Nice
Then how do we know when to use exists and when to use in ?
m from HP board and couldn&#39;t find lectures for CS syllabus anywhere :) many of your lectures matches with my syllabus so thanks a lot :) tomorrow&#39;s my CS board exam class 12
Tq sir🙏🙏🙏
Thank you so much sir 🙏
hii sir I am running above query ,as you said if we not used distinct then employee id with 5 will be repeated....but sub query is taking by default distinct value only. Please solve my issue
Why haven&#39;t we used join function here?
This question is also Written with inner join?
Thanks a ton sir!!
I am having this doubt from gate pyq of 2006<br>What if  emp. Eid and project. Eid are not primary key. <br>And there are duplicates in emp. Eid<br> how &quot;IN&quot; Will give output <br>Will it gives eid multiple time<br> or<br> it will give distinct value and eid will be only once and its respective  emp_name also be in output once??? <br>Please response sir!
Sir,may I use natural join for this question? quary will be select E_name from emp,project where emp.eid=project.eid
This IN clause work is done by JONS also<br>Can you explain
isko right join se bhi solve kar saktey hai na?
Using Join<br><br>SELECT Ename, Pname FROM Employee<br>JOIN Project<br>ON Employee.Eid = Project.Eid;
can we use the following query to solve the given problem:<br><br>select distinct e.ename from emp e, project p<br>where e.eid=p.eid
Solution 1 – using Nested Query :<br><br>SELECT Emp_name FROM Emp_table<br>Where Emp_id In (<br>  Select distinct Emp_id from Project_table ) ;<br><br>Solution 2 – using Join :<br><br>SELECT Emp_name FROM Emp_table Inner Join Project_table<br>ON Emp_table.Emp_id = Project_table.Emp_id ;
great
Sir, Can we use Natural join for this to get an answer like:<br>select ename from emp, project where emp.e_id = project.e_id ;
u should go with inner relation for it not subquery, check its performance.
sir can we do this with left,right join
Thanks ♥️
thank you sir
Sir this could be approached with Natural JOIN too right?
You lectures are very good sir. I&#39;m myself am a developer working with pho and MySQL. It would be very good if you can give a demo on real MySQL db bu running queries in it. It would be great. Just a suggestion.
Thankyou sir
hello sir your video clear my concept i have a question how we use between with sub query?
Sir can we use inner join ...because inner join gives same answer.
Bhhhttt acha smjhaya sir👍
Sir can we write query using  right join for this
select * from Employee20 where exists (select Pid from Project)
you really deserve our uni fee sir 🤣🤣🤣....
I don&#39;t understand hindi but Ur videos are very effective..  I have a question, Can we use joins instead of sub query ??
Sir can we use Natural join for this solution? I mean for eg -  .”Select E_name from Emp Natural Join Dept” would also give the same results as in case of IN operator?

very good explanation and very good channel for gate prepartion
Sir pehle ques ko right join karke bhi toh kar sakte h?
thank you sir.
you are the best Teacher, because your Teaching style is more more more.......... than super.
select Ename from Emp Natural Join Project;
select e name from employee where eid employee =eid project              kya ye kr sakte hai
We can use Joins also right?? So which one is efficient - Join or (In/ Not In)
Hi, Which query executes first in sub query(Inner or Outer)?
this can be done by natural join also na?
Sir...<br>Is the same query apply on MySQL. ???
You are best sirg ✌
can we use inner join here?
sirji, esmain natural join bhi lagt sakta tha ?? but still apne IN ki help se jo clarity de hai logic ki.. thank you so much
thank you sir
Ur God.......
You are great sir❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks alot!!!!!
Any Ravi here?
Can we accomplish the same thing through simple join?
Agar E_name ko alphabetical order mein print karna hai toh kya likhna parega..?

how to know when shoul i use this co-related nested query and when to use normal nested query ..please help
can i also use count here...for atleast condition ?
awesome explanation
Bhai mere .. Employee to Project yaa  Many To Many hoga ...  yaa fir Many to One hoga.   In case of Many to One .. Project_Id should be in Employee table. Concept clear nahi hai aapka.
I can only understand your videos as they are clear with step by step. Thank you
You should also focus on writing correct syntax (use of semi-colons).
Sir just because of you i got highest marks in DBMS in my mid term and now preparing for final term very easily with your help... Thank you so much Sir!🥰
sir good video but written wrong code<br>eid nai hoga ye code run nai hoga
A simple inner join would do the same why do we need subquery here?
this query in noy working in mysql, why?
gvery good explanation
By using join ❤<br><br><br>Select* from emp left anti join project emp.eid=project.eid;
By using join ❤<br><br><br>Select* from emp left anti join project emp.eid=project.eid;
even paid courses are not this descriptive... Truely Appreciate your effort, Love from Nepal
Sir here is a mistake....where ke bad e_id nahi lagti
You are spectacular. Such a nice explanation.
Thankyou so much !
F
Thank you so much sir for this detailed explanation, it was so helpful.
Can we use inner join for the same query?
Sir can we use Inner Join to solve this problem?
Ur videos are nice but display of subtitles just above the video...hides the query and makes it difficult to understand
Yar computer per ker k dikha
The query is wrong it should have been<br><br>Select * from employee where exists(<br>Select eid from project where employee.eid = project.eid)<br><br>Select * from employee where not exists(<br>Select eid from project where employee.eid = project.eid)<br><br>PS: we do not use column name before EXISTS or NOT EXISTS
I am Robin and I am in Bangalore . How do you know??????<br>😅
thank you so much sir ,very easy way to clear concept thank you agian and love u sir
sir jaisa koi nhi.. itna simple way me koi nhi smjha skta ..majaa aa gya sir thanks
Thank you very much. You cleared a confusing topic .
can we do it by using join and will aply some other conditition
@GateSmashers<br>First of all thank you sir for your awesome explanation. <br>But In this exist query u hv called [eid] before EXIST key that should not be called in a correlated  query. <br>the query should be like this,<br>select * from emp e<br>where  exists (select eid from projects p<br>where e.eid =p.eid );
Thank you very much. You are a genius.
THE QUERY SHOULD BE  :      SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EXISTS (SELECT EID FROM PROJECT WHERE EMP.EID = PROJECT.EID);
Very nice explanation in easy Hindi. Thanks to the instructor. I don&#39;t know his name though.
Thank you
it work in oracle or sql..or in both
Fantastic explanation.
Where ke bad EID mention nhi krenge
😟 confusion
Sir, the query for &#39;EXISTS&#39; clause, is not working in Oracle LIVE SQL. It says, &#39;invalid relational operator&#39;. Please resolve this if possible.
Two questions-<br>1. Which one is faster to execute Not in or not exists? <br>2. Will queey give same data everytime if using not in and not exists?
There is one mistake in above query Sir, It should be :<br>SELECT * FROM Emp_table e<br>WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT Emp_id FROM Project_table p<br>			    WHERE e.Emp_id = p.Emp_id ) ;
great great great explaination!!!!
sir toh why to use exist same thing can be done by in function
Select * from Employee where exists ( select * from Projects where Employee.Eid=Project.Eid);
Nice explaination ...
Why we use correlated sub query if we can get same result from subquery
Sir here before exists no need to Eid this create error in SQL
In correct query
There is a slight mistake in EXISTS query. The query should be: select * from emp where EXISTS(select E_id from Project where emp.E_id = project.E_id);
But sir ..output to dono ka same hi aayega ..  (exists or in) k case me ?
select <a href=""http://e.name/"">e.name</a>,e.address,p.pname,p.location,<a href=""http://p.pid/"">p.pid</a><br>from emp e<br>join project p<br>on e.eid=p.eid<br><br><br>this will also do the same as you done by using exist right
nice video 😍😍😍😍😍😍
i  trying  same to same query  but query not execute
AMAZING BROTHER........YOU MAKE THINGS SO SO SO SO EASY................
It&#39;s amazing how you make confusing topics look so easy. Amazing explaination sir.Hats off to you.
The arrangement of videos is not correct in play list of sql, please re arrange it please
He is a gem!
But everything ok. It may be by mistake.. Good teacher
select * from Customer where CustId in (select CustId from tblOrder where Customer.CustId=tblOrder.CustId)<br>It will be use CustId after the where clause if using In/Not in
select * from Customer where exists (select CustId from tblOrder where Customer.CustId=tblOrder.CustId)  <br>It will not be CustId after where clause if using exists
Superb Sir... 🙏 Nice explanation
Write an SQL query to fetch duplicate records having matching data in some fields of a table. sir i request you to explain this query
Thank you sir
This query have an error - right one is - select * from emp where exists(select eid from eproject where emp.eid = eproject.eid);<br>I wasted my half hour by changing me dot,dot to comma, dot to underscore, removing semicolon, dot to * etc... Finally error in outer table in b/w where and exists. ☺️
can we define multiple conditions inside the inner query?
In Simple words, Exist is equivalent to Inner JOIN
Best presentation sir, concepts are getting easy... Thank you so much sir

if only this was english
how this problem solved by nested query??
Sir, you can dub for Allu Arjun&#39;s Hindi movies; voice is very similar
The exist syntax is incorrect<br>The correct way is<br>SELECT column_name(s) <br>FROM table_name<br>WHERE EXISTS <br>  (SELECT column_name(s) <br>   FROM table_name<br>   WHERE condition);
I am very happy with your explanation which is helping me a lot to learn.<br>One of my suggestion is to bring the videos in English also.
Crystal clear explanation 😍❤
Understood completely but when to use in not in &amp; exists not exists getting confused, do we need to observe query ? nd accordingly use the keyword ? Please suggest
🔥🔥
Tip to all viewers : Watch at speed 1.5x or 1.75x you&#39;ll get much better experience.
Sir please bataye kabhi kabhi aap bole ki inner query first me chalega lekin kahi kahi btaye h ki outer query first chalega please ye bataye kon SE condition ke anusar kab excute hoga

Sir,there is a mistake
Google ads😤😠😠
Is that possible to use  exist without correlated query
Super explanation sir.Please upload the videos for  many gate cs questionpaper solutions
great
table 1 name:employee<br>table 2 name :incentives<br><br>Q) &quot;find the details of employee who is taking multiple incentives using exists&quot;<br>query:-<br>----------<br>select * from employee where Exists(select employee_ref_id from incentives where employee.employee_id=incentives.employee_ref_id group by employee_ref_id having count(*)&gt;1);
Great place, I liked all sql videos.
It is like nested for loop
operator       Time Complexity<br>In/Not in      - O(2*n)=O(n)<br>Exist/Not In - O(n^2)<br>Not sure there is something like it here exist or not bt if exist then that will must be equal to it. 😅😅
why do we have eid  before exist .Is this syntax wrong . Without using eid  before exist is giving right output. So why have you used eid   (btw i&#39;m using sql workbench-just want to know if according to this video query whether it is giving right answer or not on some other sql query tool?
Sir if exists results in true and false then according to me we are not comparing each and every record of outer query with inner query instead the condition in the inner query if satisfied displays the results of outer query
Thanks sir
thankyou sir i am totally confused in this but now i am clear thankU
Nicely explained !!! ;)
Sir, Syntax Error hai <br>Select * From Emp<br>Where Exists( -------- );
actually we don&#39;t need to write any column name before exists/non exists as we can&#39;t compare any column&#39;s value with boolean return value (true/false) of exists/non exists , it just works as :- after where if we get true(exists output) then select required details else don&#39;t"

in calculating distinct sum there is a mistake: sir you have written select distinct(sum(salary)) from emp...............             but it should be:  select sum(distinct(salary)) from emp;

Sir my college tr told <br>Count()<br>In count total number of rows including rows with thanks value from table.....<br>🤔🤔🤔
Null nai ona chaiye table ma ..ku k database constraints ma ye nai allow
You made a mistake, &quot;distinct&quot; should be inside and &quot;count&quot; should be outside to get 4 that result
Sir kya distinct(count(salary)) ki jagah count(distinct(salary)) nahi hona chahiye. I m confused, i m your hpsc pgt student
Thanks Sir Same Question Ask in Parul University Exam🙏🙏
I believe distinct should be in the middle rather than in the first;
Count salary printed 6
Aapko jitna bhi Thanks kahe autna kum he sir
You way of teaching is outstanding sir😊
Aggregate function can operate only numerical column.
One of the best YouTube channels for engineering and computer science students.👌👌
The correct syntax is :- <br><br>select count(distinct(salary)) from emp3;

Hello Sir, <br><br>I have a query if we need to print Eid, Name, Address and Dname, then is it possible to edit and get it via this query itself?
👍 thanks 😊
why all the topics of sql are not covered
You repeated lots of same info but still failed to explain as to outer table will compare  inner table with all rows regardless of if one match is already made or will it  stop comparing once a match is made.
Its been 1 continuous months hearing your voice in ×2...Now i can recognise you even in my sleep😅
u r such a great person sir.

hey! I know you work a lot for out content but nothing&#39;s ever enough haha just a suggestion jese SQL hogaya Aap uske sath pratice problems so we can implement it practicaly ese kuch karo! and not SQL eveything! Agar aap accha research karke quality links and websites  bhi bata doge students ko easy ho jayega. lets say you start hadoop ka theory ,practical kese kaha karey wog bhi bata do! please acknowledge if you read this :) and if you find this might be needed @varun and @gatesmashers

Thank you
Mja aa gya
can we use in instea of exists?
Thanks for the explanation. We can get the same result using joins as well. So what is the advantage, since the processing time for corelated or sync queries are more.
Nice
when gate smashers is there<br>there is no failing chance in college exams
Sir aapne query wrong liki hai shayad where ke baad Eid ana chaiye dono table Mai wahi common hai
👍 😀 😊 🙏
we can also use this simple subquery - SELECT * FROM Emp where Eid IN ( SELECT Eid FROM Dept )
SUPERBBBBBB
I found an alternative solution for this question... <br>Select * from Emp where Eid In (Select Eid from Dept);<br>Will it be also applicable?
What operator  can we use instead of exist
साथ me department v to print karega na
sir kabhi link de bhi diya kro video mai bolke jokes apart thankyou so much for all the videos
sir difference between exist and IN . please.
Hello Sir ! Can we write IN in place of EXISTS after WHERE clause ?
thanks gate smashers
thank you sir
And if we want department name also<br>Then what will be the Qry?
Kindly clear my one doubt..<br>we have used * in inner query then also in output dept name is not printed..why?
arrange in  order
Can we do this question by using joins
For those wondering why * has been used in the inner query, this is what I understood:<br>for each row of the employee table we are comparing with all the rows of the department table by using(dept.eid = emp.eid), because it may be possible that a single employee is working in more than one department. In lecture 62 while using exists one mistake was using E_id in front of where which is not required while using WHERE and NOT WHERE. Other than that in lec 62, the query was correct, there we were not comparing one row of  employee table with all row of project table because it was not required( at least one project)<br>Hope this helps, also please reply if you think there is some mistake.
In inner query there is select* . what will it print?
love from canada
Amazing
Thanks a lot bro.. I understood it.<br>Now I can decode complex correlated subqueries.🙏

<a href=""https://youtu.be/5FsIa4Mp3ho"">https://youtu.be/5FsIa4Mp3ho</a>
Sir ye aap imagine kiye leki employee table me hi all colum exist kare tab Hume department table ki koi jarurat nahi fir kaise kare sir
Thank you sir...I have a doubt, in the example we have written solution as &#39;where exists&#39; but in previous videos we used &#39;where e_id exists&#39;. Both are correct??
Hair ....pr....
you missed &quot;e_id &quot; after WHERE ...
Sir you explained co-related subqueries in a very accurate and brief manner. Thanks allot.
Pls explain in English
a doubt what if i ended up making my demo table which include emply detail n department in it ? on what basis one can say we had to make diff table.
great explanation boss: )
there are some mistakes in your syntex, but it&#39;s not a big problem... we just here to understand how it works. Thank you for your valuable videos🙏✨❣️🌸🙏✨❣️🌸
Sir if I want to include Department name also in details of employee than what will be the query ?
Super explanation
sir u simply explain lot of tough concepts with ease and nice example.,highly humbled sir thanxx for teaching the way u teach...
This concept is as similar as matrix multiplication
So what&#39;s the difference between in and exists?
Sir ek question hai ... previous exits\not  exits video Mai select Eid from emp where eid exits tha but isme where k baad eid kyu nhi likha gya ?
No words to express my feelings...simply thxx aloott🙏
sir first of all thnq you so much for providing such type of amazing content , your teaching style is superb cant be described ,,<br>i have a doubt <br>select * from dept will also print complete details of department table <br>i want to say that along with emp ,dept table details will also print <br>i am correct ?????<br><br>Am i right?
Great video ! <br>Can this query perform the same task yours <br>&quot; Select * from Emp where Eid IN ( Select Eid from Dept) &quot;
Good bro
But if I want the dept name as well so what would be query for this in correlated subquery
Difference between in and exist 😕
Sir ye esa nhi hoga kya??👇<br><br>... Where eid exists (...<br><br>Sirf ...where exists (... <br>Kyo lagaya?
Sir apke video bhut strength deta hai interview crack karne k liye...🙏please please plsql ka v series baniye specially package , procedure , function likhne ka tricks dijiye...<br>Please sir...<br>🙏

Is Eid missing before exist in this query??plz clarify varun sir
Kindly clear my one doubt..<br>we have used * in inner query then also in output dept name is not printed..why?
Hi  Varun Sir,<br><br>in your code,<br><br>&quot;<br>SELECT * FROM EMP<br>WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Dept WHERE d.EID = e.EID);<br><br>Why have we not put anything after WHERE?<br><br>Like, could it not be &quot;WHERE EID EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Dept WHERE d.EID = e.EID);&quot;?<br><br>PLEASE CLARIFY, SIR.<br><br><br>&quot;
A voice comes from the heart that thanks you so much sir ☺️🙏

Hi Varun, i found an issue if you can clarify in Correlated Subquery i.e. <br>select * from emp where exists (select id from dept where emp.e_id = dept.e_id); <br>in this Inner query from where we are counting &#39;id&#39; from dept. table? From my side the query should be<br><br>select * from emp where exists (select e_id from dept where emp.e_id = dept.e_id); <br><br>Hope i could make sense.<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>

Hello Sir <br>Sir agar table m highest salary 2 ya 2 se jayda  employee ki hai to hum kis employee ki id,name and salary display karenge ?
Bro today i had the interview and the interviewer asked me to retrieve the third highest salary in employee table and i wrote down the same query in Mysql but it showed the syntax error. Why ? Please let me know.
explained in different way<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJzUgfgeTAY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJzUgfgeTAY</a>
But why did u do N-1 ? ye kaun samjayega bhai
Varun sir why the compiler does not confuse here what is the logic behind this ... because using alias e1 and e2 you just mentioned a single and common table also... In place of using the Emp common table??????😢😢does it copy duplicate table internally when alias use in query ???
thanks bhayya
thank you bro, i was able to understand easily with your detailed and examples explanation, thank you !
For this query data should be in the ascending order ?
❤❤❤
You are amazing. Finally I understand how this works
Another method:<br><br>select top 1 salary from (select  top n * from employee order by salary desc)  as employee order by salary asc<br>If want nth lowest, then just shuffle asc with desc and  desc with asc in the above query.
💞♥
Select * from (SELECT * <br>FROM tbl_orders order by amount desc limit 3) as CUS<br>order by amount asc limit 1;
can  anyone update the exact sql syntax i got the logic but had a confusion in syntax
Hi @varunainashots @gate smashers....  I am using the below sql and its working for me                                                                                select employee_name , salary from employee e where n = (select count(distinct salary) from employee p where e.salary &lt;= p.salary)    or    select employee_name, salary from employee e where n = (select count(distinct salary) from employee p where p.salary &gt;= e.salary)----------- so basicalyy no n-1 concept here, please suggest if anything wrong in this.
Good Explanation sir👀
Alternate Answer for finding nth highest salary:<br><br>SELECT Salary FROM employee <br>ORDER BY  Salary Desc<br>limit 1 offset 0<br><br>Here,<br>limit means : how many output values you want to show on the screen ()<br>offset means: let assume you want to show nth (4th) highest salary . In this case you will provide offset  3 which means you<br>are leaving top 3 rows and you are choosing the 4th one . (( &quot;offset  means escaping the number of  rows from top&quot;))
Very nice and simple explanation.  Main PM hota toh apka padmashri ke liye nomination karta😅
best explanation ever.. God Bless !!
We can get the same using this Query also, <br>SELECT DISTINCT salary AS nth_highest_salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET (N-1);
Alternate Answer for finding nth highest salary:<br><br>SELECT Salary FROM employee <br>ORDER BY  Salary Desc<br>limit 1 offset 0<br><br>Here,<br>limit means : how many output values you want to show on the screen ()<br>offset means: let assume you want to show nth (4th) highest salary . In this case you will provide offset  3 which means you<br>are leaving top 3 rows and you are choosing the 4th one . (( &quot;offset  means escaping the number of  rows from top&quot;))
instead N-1, make it N and in the condition instead of &gt; make it &gt;=
SELECT *<br>FROM employees<br>WHERE salary = (<br>    SELECT DISTINCT salary<br>    FROM employees<br>    ORDER BY salary DESC<br>    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1<br>);<br><br>Is this code valid sir it returns the same ans but its easy
Alias banane ke liye as use nhi hoga kya
kutha bhi dhekega tho samaj lega sir thank you so much... wonderful explanation
how to hadle the case when there is no second highest salary, It should give null but this query is not giving any output.
Using Limit and offset also this can be achieved
You are Awesome Sir !
for this approach, salary should be sorted right?
how does he explains every topic in a clear and comprehensible manner.😭💖
hi sir, in this there is problem sir because let us take an example, where we have only 1 row data and I need the 2nd highest salary , in this case we need answer as null but we will get a empty table.
SELECT DISTINCT salary<br>FROM table<br>ORDER BY salary DESC<br>LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;<br><br>For Third Highest.
yOU make it very easy to understand......
One of the frequently asked question in interviews and placement/internships tests, thank you so such a perfect and easy explanation!!! &lt;3
Hi sir<br> is emp  two table ?<br>We are using emp e1 and emp e2 <br>Two times
Its a great query. Can anyone give me its alternative.
Those who got confused, can use this<br><br>SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary<br>FROM emp<br>WHERE salary &lt; (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp);
select id, name, salary from emp e1 where N-1 = (select count(distinct(salary)) from emp e2 where e1.salary &lt; e2.salary);
How to get course
This is very simple.......<br><br>Select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc limit n-1, 1<br><br>Here n is the nth highest. salary.
Plz someone can send me this query i am not getting the answer
you explained this complex theory in awesome way. hats off to your efforts
but what if  the highest salary is not there and we want to print null ?
Sir pls provide video for min salary
can we solve this same question by using dense_rank function()<br>select salary from<br>(select e.*, dense_rank() over(order by e.salary desc)&#39;slr_rnk&#39;<br>from employee e) x where x.slr_rnk = 123;
🎉🎉🎉🎉 awsome
what is n ....like salary, id no ,dep what is that attribure
Sir, you explain 4 th highest salary so you will printed only one value but in table there is 2 value of same salary
Bohot complicated Kiya hai
👍 😀 😊 🙏
Notes share kr skte h kya aap
Great q 🤗
Sir 2 table hai salary and advance..salary..me field name .emp id ,overduty.salary<br> increment salary , bones.salry  and mainsalary . Advance .me field  id ,advance  etc. .table record me dekna hai  .. emp id , name ,sum of overduty.salary  ,sum of advance. And left salary.. <br>Sir query kya hogi ...pls
Great .......
BEST EXPLAINATION EVER AND EVER SIR <br>THANK YOU SO MUCH<br>🥰🥰🥰🥰
What playlist we have to follow for sql?
Awesome
Nicely explained 🫡
If we Want to Find the ID of the employee who is taking the 4th highest salary then What is the answer the Query will Return..???? Because the 4th Highest Salary is 20K and there are 2 employee taking the salary 20K.....????????    <br>Please Answer Sir...🙏
superb info sir
where 3 =  3 ?????????<br>kuch bhi
awesome 👏
Very nice explanation friend. thanks a lot
Hi Varun..could you please provide a query to find nth highest salary department wise. If already available plz share the link..Not able to understand the dense rank. Can we add something to the above query explained in video.
One of the best video available in internet for correlated query👍👍
e2.salary&gt;=e1.salary🤔
Best Explanation Sir ❤
Plzzzz share the vedio about rownum and rowid concept sir..
Another Easy Query to be remembered for Nth highest salary :--<br><br>SELECT id,Salary FROM Emp <br>ORDER BY Salary DESC limit n-1,1;<br><br>Please Do upvote if it helps :)
sir apki jinti tareef ki jaye kam hai<br>you are great
Excellent Explanation..👌
very useful
select distinct(Salary) as salary from employees e1 where N-1 = (Select count(distinct(salary)) from employees e2 where e2.salary&gt;e1.salary) <br>This query will give the exact Nth highest Salary when you will apply distinct in first part of selection,  <br>If you run below query it will give the Id&#39;s where all employees will have same Nth Highest Salary .<br> select  id, salary as salary from employees e1 where N-1 = (Select count(distinct(salary)) from employees e2 where e2.salary&gt;e1.salary)
Sir, is not the id 2,3 in output for 4th highest !
Absolute savior &lt;3
ye badiya tha guru😎
Practically bhi karke dikhana chahiye sir
not working in spark sql
abb samjh me aya sirr ki Nth salary ku famous question hai ...kuki isme pura basic database grind ho jata hai   ...love your effort &lt;3
Thank you sir finally able to understand it 👌
Thank you sir, i was searching this concept from long ago, finally understood the working from your video only. Thank you for making sql easy.
I&#39;m watching it very late. And there&#39;s only one thing that&#39;s going on in my mind, ITS BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!! I&#39;m so glad that I found this channel after all. Subscribed!!
what if there is no second highest salary and we want to put NULL their? How will we do it?
count of the table is starting from 0 basically that&#39;s why we are taking n= desired number like want 3rd highest then picking 3-1 = 2 ???
hyyyy sir jab itna jabardast padha kar thank you bolte ho to mai sharma jaaata huu!
❤️
hi I tried the exact same statement shown by you but i am getting non boolean specified error
What if I have to print all the I&#39;d which is having second highest salary
great work sir beautifully explained difficult topics. it helped me a lot.
If we find the 4th highest salary.. but we have two employees with 4th highest salary( Id 2 and Id 3) then what will be printed as output, Id 2 or Id 3?
SIR... YHA PR = KYU USE KIYA HAI...IN USE KRNA THA NA
why the query used = instead of in??
for n=4 ke liye at the end limit 1 laga do kyuki duplicate 2 baar print hoge
But in my SQL...where =2 prints 4th highest salary....why so?
Superb much better than a book
nice explanation
Hi,<br> I badly need help to solve 2 SQL problem. I&#39;ll drop the problems here. If you know how to solve that it would help me a lot.<br><br>1. You are given two tables, Medicine and Hospital.<br>Medicine table containing, (ID, name, exp_date, cld)<br>Hospital table containing,(CID, branch,name)<br><br>Write a Query to display the Hospital name and count of medicines that it procures in ascending order of the hospital name.<br><br><br>2. Given two tables,  Orders and Customers<br>Order table containing (Order_No,      Purchase_amt,Cust_id,Salesman_id)<br>Customer table containing (cust_id,cust_name,city,grade,salesman_id)<br><br>Write a Query to display Customer&#39;s I&#39;d followed by the grades of the customers who placed the order sort the record as per the grades in descending order.
?
Sir we need to arrange salary column in ascending order first
Thanku sir"

Thank you ❤
The example you just took cannot be possible as it violates the property that Primary Key should be different. In that case, Q1 and Q2 will always give the same output.
3 rd questio n dubara dekho intersecton hai na ki unioun
Question 3 might have different answer in different scenarios
Sir in Question 3, would&#39;nt the intersect query give result as 1,2,3,3 as it is common in both tables?? It should not give unique result right?
Good video&#39;s and good explanation 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Sir..in first question..4 th option*A%.  ..need explanation on that
Delete koi command nhi hoti ???
You are a great teacher of SQL.
Bai  Tera teaching 💥 tqs Bai 👏
👍 😀 😊 🙏
Great sir
bow down to hero.......
Best explanation sir
superb sir
3rd question dekh lena
Thankyou Sir
In ques. 1 option are diff which you describe and which given option  &#39;%A_&#39; and &#39;_A%&#39;  both similar or not ??
Please make vedieo any and all command in sql
You&#39;re one of the best teacher I&#39;ve ever seen in my career...... Bless you sir ji...🙌🏼
BEST BEST BEST<br>THANKU FOR THIS AMAZING COURSE SIR❤
you are the best you  are  pointing out small details in sql which is very facinating
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKQcn0sLZGM&amp;t=5m29s"">5:29</a> sr delete table command hoti to h or aapne delet ,drop,truncate me difference bhi btaya h🙄
Thanks sir ji ☺️❤️🙏🏻
sir g lov u khush rahen ... good teacher &lt;3 ...
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKQcn0sLZGM&amp;t=5m30s"">5:30</a> delete table &lt;table name&gt; command hoti hai na sir isse stuctue ko kuch nahi hota par us attribute ki sari values clear ho jati hai aap ne hi aapni ek lecture me padhata tha
You are one of a kind. We wasted 4 years in university but not a single teacher teach any subject like you do and for all your subjects. Bro, you are the Greatest Channel for Asian CS students. Live Long Man.
Note: MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).
Hi Varun, you are doing good but I have one concern that is, I want to know how can we delete duplicate records from the table ?<br>Most of the interviewers ask this question?
There is always a primary key in a table, so by that logic q1 and q3 produce same result
Thanks for such efforts, you are literally making future for millions of Indian students...
_ is for one character,<br>% is for string or no of characters,<br>But whats the purpose of *(star) ??<br>Or it&#39;s just as option.
sir, agar mai use karu union instead of intersect to output kya aaengaa??
In question 3, Sir, There shouldn&#39;t be the same tuples in a table in general.  So, Q1, Q2 and Q3 all queries should give the same output.
Thanks for such quesitions and for a great lecture
If in future anyone asked me &quot;Resources to learn SQL and DBMS &quot; ... undoubtedly I will recommend your videos
@Gate Smashers In Q.3 are we assuming that there are no primary key? Because if any of a , b is primary key than answer could be different ?
best explanation
Sir, let say we have to preserve position of &#39;A&#39; in 10000th place, then should we write &quot;_&quot; 9999 times ??, It is not good idea I think, is there any bettar approch for this??
Thankyou sir
best explaination....
Am getting confused as delete command to remove only relations not full structure then y said delete not exist??
Nice brother usefull
Gained new knowledge ☺️♥️
Q3:i guess option b is correct
👍
Great😊😊
COMMENT YOUR COLLEGE NAME ; LETS TELL YOUR JUNIORS THAT YOU EXIST
sir , ek doubt hai, Aapne bola ki relation me koi tuple repeat ho rhi to distict uss repeated tuple ko bas ek baar dikhayega. Magar ek table me koi tuple dobaar kyu mentioned hoga considering ki primary key unique hote hai?
Thanks for the explanation.<br>Efforts appreciated sir.
heres one way : SELECT TOP 1 salary FROM( SELECT TOP 3 salary FROM EMP ORDER BY DESC) ORDER BY AESC;
Query to display the name whose middle letter is given????
Thank You  Sir
Thanku so much sir
Fan😬
&lt;3
in question 3,can i take two columns like a and b ?
Thank you sir
Nice explanation sir

One mistake I found, &#39;access&#39; means to be able to read the table i.e. from security perspective and &#39;read&#39; the table means you already have access to table and you want to get data out of table, otherwise, good explanation!
i am studying one day before of my exam.
Thank you sir ...!!!

Sir already knows ki hum 2X pe hi Dekhne vale h 😂...
can any one help me,<br>when B=B+1000 is said the value of B is updated in primary memory ,then what is the use of performing W(B) again
best 👍
but even if the transaction failes at the last operation or the commit operation or the 100th operation then also we will rollback
Anyone who is watching this just before 2 hours of exam at 1.75x ?
Your teaching style is very amazing and it&#39;s helped to understand very easly

thankyou so much!!! You are really making so helpful videos for us..wonderful explanation ...stay safe and healthy sir!!
Sir aap is video me haste najar aate hai. Ese hi haste rahiye aur video bhi interesting lagta hai❤❤
When a program becomes process i.e it is loaded in RAM, it is in active state.
in short, CPU is also known as operating system just consider, whatever data we stored in system it goes to hard disk but when we want to access ,read ,write the data it comes from hard disk to RAM or CACHE memory after performing read ,write when we want to save it it saves in RAM then HARDDISK also saves in hardisk lastly after successful when the  transaction ends  which is also known as commit when somtimes due to network issues transactions become unsuccessful then abort the system means it restart we need to rety the payment or anything ...

Tutor has extreme indepth knowledge. These info even not shared by other main stream learning portal globaly. You are rocking...
I just realised something sir like so in every transaction the first operation will be subtract from the respective account that we has deduction part so that is the reason sometime transaction fails but money get deducted and will refund after 3 to 4 days according to the company so that is why there is never a case in which the second account got the money but at first account money  didn&#39;t deducted 😆
U r best teacher i have ever seen in my life ...YOUR REAL LIFE EXAMPLES ARE JUST AWESOME

Such a nice teacher, keep it up 👍
Wow Yaar!
thank you &lt;3
Super Varun.. you are the GEM
Very well explained as always😊
in short,schedule the way of excecution serial means it completes one by one transaction for example appiontment of a a doctor ,doctor need to check one by one but the disadvantage is waiting time and parallel means at a time lot of transactions occur for exaple in amazon lot of people do shooping ,,,
thank you sir :)
There is difference between serial vs parallel vs concurrent
Legends are watching in the morning before exam
engineering students like here
Ap chronology samj rhe ho??
Nice
Is upi is a example of parallel schedule system ???
👌
If in serial transaction t1 is failed t2 trancation will start or not?
thankyou so much sir
watching this one night before the dbms exam
For those who are watching before exam ...you can even watch at 2x speed even yet the video is understandable
Amazing your teaching skills 😃 <br> apke video dekh ke hi mere sare doubt clear hojate he 🙏
ALL ARE TEMPORARY ... IRCTC PERMANENT😎😎😎😎😎😎
Why don&#39;t you start your own institute to teach? The way you teach is remarkable. You&#39;re gem. Keep up with your good work.

Sir I am very sure initially you were working for INDIAN RAILWAYS that&#39;s why you miss Indian Railways so much😆😆<br>Sir isn&#39;t that you who made IRCTC app😂😂<br>Btw your content is definitely good<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
Given a uni-processor system a schedule cannot be parrent but non-serial (concurrent). Also i could not find any reference to parrel schedule on other platforms. I know non-serial does not mean parallel. Please either explain or correct.
Sir, Aap bhi Sandeep Maheshwari k show main aayo plz
Summary<br>Schedule:<br>It is chronological execution sequence of multiple transaction.<br>Type of Schedule:<br>1)Serial Schedule<br>2)Parallel Schedule<br>Serial:<br>if a transaction is started then other transaction will be start after end of ongoing transaction.<br>** Serial schedule is always consistent.<br>** waiting time of another transaction is high<br><br>Parallel :<br>Multiple transaction executed at a time like if there are three transaction t1 t2 and t3 then for some amount of time t1 will execute a set of operation and some amount of time a t2 will execute a set of operation and so on.<br>**It may or may not be consistent<br>** waiting time of another transaction is low

This video should have been sponsored by IRCTC for their app promotion 😂

you have not explained phantome tuple nad enrepeated read at all just displayed maybe its usefull in your goal(gate) but in college exams they ask about it its in our portion and in detail
Explanation was not good. Take more example of it .
This video is bit rushed I guess rest all previous videos I found were weel explained..
In lost update I don&#39;t thing there was anything related to &quot;likes&quot;. It was all about &quot;quantity&quot;.
Sir, what is the meaning of &quot;Read after write&quot;?
This dude ⬆️⬆️ is a real help, he was recommended to me by someone and really helped me out so greatly by recovering my crypto sent to the wrong wallet, I’m so excited having everything back ad making the right transaction he’s good 👍.

Ifp😅😮
Unless the transaction is completed values will not be committed in the database right , then how can second transaction read can get the value that is write in transaction 1
thanks
example was amazing

Nice
How come T1 W(A)-&gt; 20 gets reflected in T2 R(A) -&gt; 2  before committing?
🥰🥰
Ok
Please teach in english..
Sir please upload videos in English too, it would help a lot to students abroad who don&#39;t know Hindi.Thank you.
IRCTC be like - &quot;Have mercy on me plz.&quot;
Sir transaction 1 jab commit hua hi nahi or wo fail ho gaya to Database m kuch bhi change hue bina transaction 2 ne value kse le Li or jab transaction 2 ne value le li to iska matlab h ki usne database se value li Hogi jo ki transaction 1 k commit hone k baad change huii hogi <br>To phir transaction 1 committ hone k baad fail kse Ho sakti H
OP Example ...
mai bhi rolla pa gaya @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_oI0jLqlVY&amp;t=6m14s"">6:14</a> 😂😂
US BRO US <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_oI0jLqlVY&amp;t=5m49s"">5:49</a>
after w(A) in T1, transaction to commit hui hi nhi, so T2 ko A=70 milna cahiye because database me A=70 h
how value will be written as 20 in T1 txn without commit ?...T2 must read value 70 until txn is committend by T1.<br><br>Please correct me if i am wrong.
Sir, if on T2 side we are having R(A) and W(A) then how come in T1 side after that we are having R(B) and W(B)?
watching this for revision for end terms of 4th sem. Thank you sir ji!
Sirr joo apka payment hai 159 per month ossa app huma pora videos provide krr doge kyy?
2nd example clear my all doubts 😂😂
Sir,are u married?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_oI0jLqlVY&amp;t=4m40s"">4:40</a> sir data base me 40 value to t2 ne kari aur vo to successfully execute ho gaya aur t1 ne to database me koi changes hi ni kiye to fir jab t1 rollback hua to database ki value change kyo Hui?
Railway example at the end made everything clear... thanks🙏
Sir , how T2 will read the value of A from t1 ? T2 will not take information from the database because database is not updated. Please tell sir.
BEST BEST BEST<br>THANKU SO MUCH FOR THIS COURSE SIR❤
i had a doubt. whenever we do read of a it reads from database . and that information comes in cache memory . right?<br>if that&#39;s the case then transaction 2 will take information of a directly from db which is still same coz transaction  1 is not committed .and it will not cause any problem. am i right?
me vi rolla paa denayee😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tq tqsm sir this vedio is very helpful..and i understand easily
Super explanation Bhai Bahut useful during revision ❤️
Thanks Parmish Verma....Waise  Ye Channel kab Khola aapne? or next song kab aayega?
Sir in T1 -w(a) you are not commited then how other transactions t2-Read(a)= 20 ,it must be read 70 .because in your previous video you say after commit database value change.
Thank you so much!❤️
BEST TEACHER ...THANKU SIR FOR HELPING ALL OF US
thankssss sir concept clr

hey can you tell me where is write and write video in the topic of TRANSACTION DBMS
Sir, this is not added in the DBMS playlist. Kindly add it as well. Btw your playlist is really cool. Thanks for the content!
Your presentation is nice and simple
Will u please make the videos on complete DBMS or sql query 🙏🙏🙏
sir when rollback occurs then , it will Add 50 to value present in Database or just update value of database to 70 ? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_oI0jLqlVY&amp;t=4m10s"">4:10</a>

Sir T2 A ka value T1 se kyu read karta hai directly database se kyu nahi read karta ...kyu T1 and T2 depend hai ek dusre par.... please real life example dijiye sir.please

Irctc 😂 wants to know your location 😂😂<br>Irctc be like- muze kyu maara😂😂
Thankyou so much sir
Just a small correction. the read by T2 wont happen from database, but from the value of A stored in the local buffer of RAM. since it has already been read once by T1 before, so no need to go to the database again.
There is no single video of sir when he&#39;s not giving example of IRCTC 😀

isn&#39;t is the same as write-read conflict or dirty read conflict?
Dhanyavaad ji.
hello sir, i have a question, here how T2 can fetch the data directy from T1 as T1 is still not commited , so doesn&#39;t T2 should read(A) from the database where the value of A in the database is still 10?
Am Sorry to T2
Is the irrecoverable schedule similar to lost updates??
Dhyaan se dekho T2 ko, T2 ne bhi to kuch kiya tha 😂😂
English
irrecoverable me n dirty read problem me dono concept same bataya hai aapne matlab dono same hai
Thank you🎉❤ exam achha gaya
U are the best sir❤❤
What&#39;s the real life example of irrecoverable schedule?
Irrecoverable schedules<br>If a transaction does a dirty read operation from an uncommitted transaction and commits before the transaction from where it has read the value, then such a schedule is called an irrecoverable schedule
T1 -&gt; W(A) writes the A into Buffer or persists A into database?<br>If so why do we need to Commit?<br>R(A) means reading data item A from DB right?<br>How can T2 -&gt; R(A) give A=5 ? incase T1 has not committed yet ?
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Ok
Ek din main DBMS complete.....chances to score more in DBMS .....great teaching sirjiii thnkuuuu❤️🔥

THnku bhaiya 😁😁
Thank you ,thank you,thank you so much sir....<br><br>This video will very helpful for us..<br>Thank you so much sir once again....
sir please make videos on distributed operating system. Your videos are so good, the topics can be understood quite well.
Sir most of the students of my batch study dbms from you.<br>Thanks a lot sir! You are a blessing to engineering students🙌🙌🙏🙏
Where is recoverable
Even the greeting, &quot;Hello friends&quot; looks so genuine and warm
T2 start by reading 5 from local buffer (shared memory). It write back 3 (5-2) to local buffer and finally to database at commit point.<br><br>T1 which is yet to commit; i.e. the value it updated from 10 to 5 (i.e. latest value of A=5) is in local buffer only and not changed in database permanently. Therefore, on rollback T1 will change value of A back from 5 to 10 in local buffer only and that makes sense because it never updated value of A in database.<br><br>Hence, updated value of A in database is 3.<br><br>As only T2 committed successfully, the value should have been 10-2 i.e. 8
Sir aapne recoverability nhi bataya aapne
this example is the same as the one which u gave in write read problem.
❤️❤️💕💕
Recoverable schedule?
you said that when T2 reads the value of A, it reads 5. but how? T1 has not committed . T2 should read 10 as the value of A nah???
Watching 5 hours before exam..
Sir this is same as the dirty read
Your Content Helps so much in managing our projects. Really Thankful to You From Pakistan
Changing the value committed by T2 from 10 to 3 via a rollback, would violate the DURABILITY property of a transaction. I don&#39;t think the rollback can change an already committed value.
Titu dirty read kr gya.🙂
Sir thumbnail galat lag gaya shayad se <br>Recoverable ka part toh aaya hi nahi hai 😅
BEST BEST BEST<br>THANKU SO MUCH FOR THIS COURSE SIR❤
lekin jab T1 transaction commit hi nahi kar rahe hai to , T2  to actual database se hi read karega?
Sir ek baat batiye transaction t1 ka alag system hoga transaction t2 ka alag hoga toh phir t1 database se read karne ke baad, jab tak t1 commit nhi ho jata tab tak t2 kaise t1 ki value le sakta h. t2 ko bhi toh 10 database se pehle  read karna hoga . phir wo t1 ki value kyu lega
sir ur teaching is excellent .Its my request to make videos in english language . so that any language student can understand sir.
Sir if R(A) is committed then how can you rollback full transaction after R(B) failed?
In T1 we didn&#39;t use commit insted value will be updated in actual database but you said in previous video that only after commit operation updation will be there in real database
Where is recoverable ??
is dirty read and irrecoverable schedule meant the same thing??
Feeling sad for titu :)
When T1 has done with  W(A) still in DB A=10 cz Comitt is not done yet . So As you have explained that T always Read data from DB but when T2 is performing R(A) A should be 10 right ?? cz in T1.. commit has not been performed yet hence value of A in DB is still 10 not 5.<br><br>please clear this doubt.
very good explanation
Hello Sir U didn&#39;t talk about recoverable schedules here??
sir please make videos in English so that every region students get benefitted
informative lecture
We here depending on u sir please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Please sir explain for this🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Although at last the database will take a value of 3 for T1, when it (T1) will be rollbacked after its failure which is not consistent,<br>And at last the data of the database which was 10 at beginning and only 5 is taken by T2 it should have 5 more data but now its having only 3 <br>There is a los of 2 data<br>Here i considering data as tickets
Sir how the database is updated with 10 after 3 because there is no such commit in T1
Sir ek Recoverable schedule ke baare mai bhi ek Example sir dedete
Sir T1 and T2 should be independent and  T2 should take the value from db not from T1. It is little confusing for me🤔
Thankyou sir
Yaar ye to bada dangerous glitch hai
Basically it means If I initiate a transaction in Indian railway(Booking 2 tickets out of total 10) and after reaching to payment gateway(WRITE OPERATION DONE) if at this point of time another user logins say from anonymous place then to him 8 tickets will be shown...I think I am correct?
What about recoverable schedule transactions ?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2gZKA8E1yA&amp;t=4m17s"">4:17</a> ye zyada ho gya sir
is irrecoverable is possible in real life scenario?
transaction failure and natural disaster ,interesting very interesting
is it irrecoverable or recoverable ???
exam smbhal loge bhai tum toh 🤣
As you say that any data will not update in database before the commit state so if any transition  perform any action in his RAM memory and not committed at same point of time other transition  start and want to read value so the other transition should read database  value why that transition using  first transition  RAM value
isn&#39;t it like, when the commit is called only then the value is updated in the database?? you said when W is called value is updated in database. some guy in the comments told that if a write is performed in 1 transaction then another transaction will read that value from the buffer and not DB. so if that is the case ,  when the roll back is called why does it update the value back to 10 in DB? it&#39;s not necessary coz commit wasn&#39;t called by t1 hence the value wasn&#39;t updated in the DB so why rollback value to 10.<br>How  a buffer or RAM is shareable for two different transaction made by two different users, totally confused please sir help
Your explanation is very excellent sir keep it up
I FOUND THIS VIDEO LITTLE BIT CONFUSING. WHY ?? <br>READ MORE TO KNOW THE REASON<br><br><br>In T1, final step of the transaction i.e., commit is not performed. And as we know that until we don&#39;t commit any transaction, value remains unchanged in the database. <br>This is why I am saying that value of A remains unchanged before T2.<br>  <br>As per your previous vidoes, it is a rule that data requested by an authorised user for executing a transaction should be accessed from the database ( server ) only.<br><br>So, the value assigned to T2 should be 10 instead of 5. And this is how the solution look alike.<br><br>Please correct me if I am wrong.
Great😊
u r great sir... u have cleared my doubts..
Sir I have dought that ,t2 need to read from the database not from the value of the t1 which is written as per your 61st videos. Because always read is done from db not from the other transaction values.
Sir T2 to database se value lega na ... T2 kisi data ki value  T1 se q lega... ... Jaise aaap bolay ki  T2 R(A) KI VALUE A-5 Lega .... T2 DATABASE SE SE VALUE Q NAI LEGA... PLZ REPLY SIR............ SIR AAP  MAST PADHATY..... COA KI POORI PLAY LIST DEKHI...US K NOTES B BDHIYA BANAYE ..... DBMS K 60 HOGYE.....  SIR...WILL REMEMBR U IN PRAYS..
sir int this video only irrecoverable,where recoverable??
Thanks sir g
Sir pls do more questions on read write problem
Sir, you said a different concept in the previous video that t2 transaction will read the value from the database as t1 has not committed the operation.  Please clarify
Brother it is little confusing <br>Once T2 commit the value of A wil be 3 ....now even T1 fails and it will rollback but it won&#39;t be able to update value of A from 3 to 10 in DB. So it is irrevocable. Because T2 already had commit before failing of T1. <br>But u are saying in the end that T1 will update the value to 10 from 3.<br>So commit of T2 has gone and it is not recoverable.<br><br>Please clarify if I am wrong.<br>DB will have 3 not 10.
sir in the previous video you said the t2 trasnaction will read from database, but here it is conflicting.
nc explanation sir
we didn&#39;t do commit when it fails to execute then how could we change the database value to 10 again?
is it race condition in os?
thnkk u so much ji...u r all vedioes are vry vry helpful for us....saty blessed...🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Is this the complete video of irrecoverable vs Recoverable? Did not seemed like it&#39;s completed..Can someone please let me know where is the complete video?
Is recoverable schedule serial schedule??
sir i  from electronics and telecom but have comp organization in ESE syllabus kindly make videos for us. lectures are awesome sir thanks a lot bhai
Just awesome. I never seen this kind of explanation before.
can someone please  explainwhy transaction 2 would read value of A as 5 but not 10?<br>in video about read-write conflict , you&#39;ve said the transactions will read the same value from the database and not the intermediate value.
Sir next video upload kigiye na plz sir
Sir please 2pl and time stamp per video bna do plz
Thanxs sir for <a href=""http://this.it/"">this.it</a> is very helpful for me

href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=01m30s"">01:30</a>](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=90)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=90)</a> Cascading vs Cascadeless Schedule<br>- Cascading schedule allows transactions to read uncommitted data, leading to inconsistencies.<br>- Cascadeless schedule ensures that transactions can only read committed data, maintaining consistency.<br><br>[<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=02m56s"">02:56</a>](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=176)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=176)</a> Cascading rollback is used to remove write-read problem in database transactions<br>- Cascading rollback automatically aborts all transactions that are working on dirty data<br>- Failing one transaction can result in the rollback of multiple transactions<br><br>[<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=04m25s"">04:25</a>](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=265)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=265)</a> Cascading schedules lead to degraded performance due to wasted CPU cycles.<br>- CPU utilization is affected due to failure in the cascading schedule.<br>- In a cascading schedule, efforts of multiple processes are wasted, leading to decreased system performance.<br><br>[<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=05m59s"">05:59</a>](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=359)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=359)</a> Cascading schedule vs Cascadeless schedule<br>- Cascading schedule leads to wasted CPU utilization and degraded performance.<br>- Cascadeless schedule ensures that transactions cannot read a value until the transaction that wrote it is committed or aborted.<br><br>[<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=07m26s"">07:26</a>](<a

schedule ensures that a transaction does not read uncommitted values from another transaction in the database<br>- Cascadeless schedule avoids the cascading effect where a transaction reads uncommitted values and leads to inconsistencies<br><br>[<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=08m46s"">08:46</a>](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=526)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=526)</a> Write after write is allowed and does not cause any issues in terms of recoverability.<br>- After a write operation, read operations should not be performed on the same data until a commit is done.<br>- When a transaction fails and is rolled back, the changes made by the transaction will be undone and the initial values will be restored.<br><br>[<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=10m04s"">10:04</a>](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=604)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=604)</a> Write write problem and lost updation problem<br>- Write write problem occurs when the work done by a transaction is lost if it fails. For example, if a transaction updates the value of A to 100 and another transaction updates it to 90, the first transaction&#39;s update is lost.<br>- Lost updation problem occurs when the value updated by a failed transaction is not reflected in the database, causing inconsistencies. For example, if a transaction fails after updating the value of A to 80, the database value will still be 100.
LEC - 81, Done ✅ THANK YOU SIR ❤
Sir please give me video strict shadule🙏
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> bina commit kiye kaise database mai change ho raha hai kyuki aapne hi bola tha bina commit likhe database mai change nahi hoga to agar database mai change nahi ho raha to T2, and T3 ko to wahi real wala value read karna chahiye na jo database mai and suppose agar commit likh ke database mai change kar bhi diya ho then uske baad T2 operate kar raha hai then T1 ke fail hone ka to chance hi nahi hai according to aapke purane lecture thoda confusion ho raha hai
t2,t3,t4 be like: mehnat barbaad ......, great example sir
after committe ,how it is possible to rollback , don&#39;t it lead for lost of durability property
What happen if T4 fails
Sir, Madam keh rahi thin ki @gatesmashers se padh kar intelligent to ho jaoge Lkn tameez nhi aayega kabhi... Sir ek Lecture tameez pr bhi ho jaye... Main Ma&#39;am ko dikhaoonga ki Tameez bhi sikha rahe Sir... 😁
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=11m00s"">11:00</a> Why if T2 commit done 80 will not reflect in DB. <br><br><br>Can anyone clear my doubt
Shedule<br>Have <br>Serial and parallel shedule <br>Recoverable data, irrecoverable data<br>Cascading , cascadeless
Amazing explanaition!!. Stupid BITS faculties made a heck to explain these. Here its completely simplified. Prof UMA Maheshwari please learn something from here.
Your teaching style is just awesome!
bhai tu har jagah ek hi example de ke bol raha hai ye recoverable hai,irrecoverable ,cascading aur cascadeless sab kuch ek sath hai
gate smashers se padh k jao exam mein fir &quot;koi panga nahi hai&#39;&#39; 100% guarantee!!
the same example pupped in my mind just before sir gave that same example🙄
Watching at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=2m13s"">2:13</a> at night 😴
80 completed.50 to go 🙂
Best example of the decade 😂😂💀
Sir just now in last videos you said that the operations wont be performed on the data in database in hardisk until the commit is used, and all operation will be performed on the data that is load on RAM (main memory) then how you can say that after fail of T1 and commit operation of T2 the value of A which is in database will get restored 😕 the data in RAM can get restored but data in database cannot get restored becoz as u said the CPU cannot perform on hardisk.
YouTube please 3×
He is the best  😊 koi panga nhi hain
I seems like that sir, you are not present on YouTube than 90% are fail in AKTU examination 🤣
feels like studying Os 😂😂
2x gang mark there attendence 😁
4.50 @Ashish Chanchlani 😎🙌
How comes databse is getting updated without commit and other transaction is getting that updated value fo transction 1 if transaction 1 is not commit!!<br><br>Awaitng for your revert!
5.30 lol
best
I turned the subtitles on but it just doesn&#39;t make sense to me eventho many say it&#39;s a great video. I feel like it&#39;s great too but too bad I just don&#39;t understand.
Sir i have a question plz sir ans ...<br>Diff betn cascadeless schedule and serial schedule
t4 t2 t3 directe  database se read ku nhi krti jb t1 commite hogi to automatic unke pass update  ho jaye gi fail hogi to a=100 hi rhega

Great Explanation Sir ! Thank you!!
tino ne kafi mahenat ki hai copy karne mai LOL!! bohot mahenat
Best teacher ❤️❤️
thank you
BEST BEST BEST<br>THANKU SO MUCH FOR THIS COURSE SIR❤
Amazing explanation! was struggling with the difference between cascadeless and strict schedules! finally it got resolved! Thanks a lot sir!
matlab aisi example do ke bacha exam hall main bhoole hi na, kyoonke cascading ki example aankhon ke saamne chal rahi hai...hats off sir
Sir cascading schedule mai ye sabhi transactions ek system mai ho rhe h ya alag alag system around the world ki baat kar rhe h kyuki alag alag ke liye read karna toh possible nhi hoga na
sir you have not explained strict  recoverable .
I think in this case <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=11m00s"">11:00</a> of write write problem will not occur. It will cause problem if both transactions are committed, then it will lead to lost update problem.
example tagda dia h aapne sirr XD
sir you skip two topics recoverrable schedule and strict recoverable schedule and also no numericals . 😔😔😔😔
Ty
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=3m12s"">3:12</a> T1 fail to Ram main hoi h, to hard main 100 update qn kry gi after rollback? update to sirf commit hony pr hona chahya?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=11m04s"">11:04</a> T2 commit k baad 100 q ho gi 80 q ni ho gi?
your examples are always ooppppp 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂
Will the cascadeless schedule is under series scheduling???
Iss example kai baad ab yeh kabhi nhi bhulega 😂😂😂
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=5m00s"">5:00</a> Best Example ever! Great Explanation sir!
One Doubt : In the second table he told that cascadless the other transaction cannot read same value till first one is executed means problem sorted but later he said that in write write i.e table 3 it will cause problem .. but my doubt is how will it write(A) without REading A ..  and If he is reading A how can we say it is cascedless
👍👍
no video on recoverable schedule?
Your videos more help into the final exam🥰
create lectures on Data Mining
Data Mining pay bhi lectures banaye
Sir if t2 fails and t1 is still operating then what will happen to t1 is will also roll back or  it will continue to operate?
thank you sir very much!!!!!!!!!
But in cascading t1 fail hone se pehle t2 commit karle to rollback kaise hoga?
sir if t1 reads, and then t2 reads writes and gets committed. Now when we resume and write in t1, then wouldn&#39;t it work on the original value that t1 had read before t2 occurred?
Your  examples are awesome 😂😂
bhaiya, aapne pichle video me recoverable schedule toh samjhaya hi nhi, irrecoverable samjhaya bs, isiliye kahi aur jaana pada mujhe. anyways.. thanks for the awesome videos
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=10m55s"">10:55</a> why 80 is not reflected in database..after commit also
One word for your videos Fabulous 👍🏻👍🏻
This video has rollback problem. doesn&#39;t resume, starts again over and over.
Other teachers  :- &quot;Cheating kyo kri tum longo ne&quot;<br>Varun Sir            :- &quot;teeno ne kaafi mehnat ki he copy krne he&quot;😂😂😂
😁 thankyou sir (students example)
Query: write karne ke baad database me change hota hai ki Buffer me.??
Thanks sir ..
Seriously hats off &quot;.. well explained.
bhai sabkuch samajh aa raha h bas ye bata do ye dono transaction local memory ka data share kese kar paa rahe h like isolation property follow kyu nahi ho rhi yaha ki dusra transaction pehli ke me interfere nahi kar sakta aur batao yaar bhut confusing hota jaa rha h sabkuch like koi irctc ka example deke batao ye chiz
So we tried to make serial schedule as parallel as possible, but we end up committing the schedule and then start another.. that means we didn&#39;t achieve anything parallel? Please sir answer this
cute storyteller
i  am sitting  like baby who is watching fairy tales and laughing as if i am watching some comedy track ,and i enjoying the lesson
1st vale ko sb pitenge😃😃😂
One confusion...<br>When t1 fails then t1 is roll backed.correct?<br>At that time t1 read  A as 100.Fine?<br>Then next task is write (A) means A-50 that gives A as 50.Correct?<br>And after write (A) of t1 then t2 read (A)  na? ?<br>Then it will gives 50 not 100??<br>Suggestions opinions are acceptable 🙆🙇<br><br>That is the task sequence is like as follows. .<br>For t1: read (A)<br>For t1:write (A)<br>For t2 :read (A)
Example is really understandable
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=9m31s"">9:31</a> iske uper koich nhi bola isne !! haha .. Sir jaisa koi hardich nhi h !!
Example 😂😆🤣
Super example for cascading schedule 👌
i&#39;m one of t2 t3  t4
Cascadeless mein jo write write problem discuss hua hai.. us mein pehle commit karne se irrecoverable schedule ho jaana chahiye na? Sir ne toh bola ki problem kuch nhi hoga.. but irrecoverable schedule mein aisa hi example diye the sir.. commit ho rha tha failure ke pehle
haha great example of cascading schedule
Sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt1pk5LEBU&amp;t=10m53s"">10:53</a> you said that write-write conflict is happened but I am not getting why T2 cannot commit. Can you explain it?
Example was excellent 👌😂😂😂
I understood everything because of you ☺️♥️
&quot;Koi panga ni hai&quot;. Best teacher ever!

Student example of cascading is interesting and funny. 😁😁😁
but sir! T1 only read-write on RAM, not on Hard drive. So, how can other transactions read unchanged values on HD?"

sir sorry to interrupt, but as i&#39;ve seen your lecture on Scheduels, you&#39;ve mentioned that In a serial schedule transactions execute one by one after they committ. So just a doubt, did you forget to write commit after w(A) or it can be executed without commit?
Tomorrow is my end sem and and like before also I clear my doubts here ...tnqs sir

why might it take a long time to do a transaction when using a  optimistic approch of transaction?
Pranam sirji... One of the best ❤✨
Sir apke maths 1 ke lec bhi hai kya?
Sir if a schedule is serializable then does that mean that we will convert the parallel schedule to serial actually? If yes then how will we get the benefits of parallel schedules and how will be get rid of drawbacks of serial schedules?

please make  videos in english too there are peoples around the world who want to learn from you.
For any schedule S1 if there exist conflict equivalent schedule S2 and if S1 is serializable then we can say that S2 is also serializable.
why R(A)  = R(A) non conflict    ?????????????????
What language are you speaking ? is it english or something else?
Thankyou sir love you❤
how to convert from conflict serializable into serial, for three transactions, how to select the adjacent pairs, and how to manage the swaps, with conflicting pairs, if anyone knows this, kindly reply

Thanks for the explanation. 👍
Seriously good videos. Great work. This is the best series one can found in DBMS. I can bet even paid courses are nothing in front of this series. I wish I had found this earlier.
Thx
Jaha pe adjacent non conflict pairs hoge waha pe position change<br>Conflict me no position change<br>And S ka conflict equivalence S&#39; = serializable <br>Thank you so much sir ❤️
What If all those marked pairs at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckqDozxECp0&amp;t=6m10s"">6:10</a>  would be non conflicting? Such as w(A) R(B) and then W(A)
One doubt sir.<br>How to do in case of 3 transactions?
Thank you!
Thankyou so much sir
Thanks sir...for this simple explaination
Thankyou sir
Great sir ..u r such a nice teacher .. easily explained the topic ..
T1 - R(A) W(A)......... R(B) fail<br>T2  -                 R(A) W(A) <br>Sr tell me still T2 will also abort? <br>2nd case<br>T1 - R(A) W(A) commit......... R(B) fail<br>T2  -                 R(A) W(A) <br>So tell sr t2 will abort Or not
Waah ! Maza a gaya padh k
sir I think , you have made a mistake in the beginning example , -----&gt; we don&#39;t have w(B) in first transaction , but in non-conflict schedules -you have written w(B) -R(A) , and you have missed w(a)-R(A) , I think we need to replace  w(a)-R(A) with w(B) -R(A) ,correct me if I am wrong.
Bhai bhut achy sy samjaya h.. thanks
Outstanding
so here i am , in 2 days i completed whole dbms from your playlist to save my end sem exam but apart from exam , now i came to know that how much this subject is interesting , so  thank you sir for your videos
Everything is so clear that I remember this even after 6 months and too without even revising
Hello friends chai pi lo wali aunty ki trah sruat krta ho. Nice lecture of dbms.
Sir how to find how many non serial schedule??????
let&#39;s say the following is a part of some schedule(involving 2 transactions only):<br>T1: w(x) T1: commit T2: w(x). <br>Is this a conflicting pair ??
Very nice 🔥😘😘😘sir ji😘😘
In this video, mind it , you have mentioned swapping of position but again mind it that it should be the swapping in time not the position. Please think it carefully. Swapping in position and swapping in time are different thing. I encourage your lecture after all.
Sir, Is there any particular method for checking the non-conflict pair? like top to bottom or bottom to top?
Sir i&#39;m watching knowledge gate <br>Then i jump towards your channel <br>I think it&#39;s little bit better than knowledge gate but he is also a brilliant channel like u
Thank you sir.
u r amazing sir😍😍😍😍tq so much sir ...concept clr in first watching😘
Great explanation sir...thnkk u so much jiii..stay blessed...🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
You are amazing teacher
I&#39;m grinding my whole dbms , os  syllabus from you only sir, thanks a lot for all this.....
Can u narrate in english
you are doping a great work sir
consider the following schedule s of transaction T1,T2,T3 . T1:R(X),W(Y);T2:R(X),W(Y);T3:W(X),W(Y) <br>identify the number of conflict equivalent serial schedule of s
Thanku so much sir ji
Nicely explained. What if both schedules don&#39;t have any conflict operations among their transactions T1 T2 (transactions working on different data item) can we say these schedules are conflict equivalent?
Better of all  words I  would just like to say thank you so much...!❣️
I learned more in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckqDozxECp0&amp;t=7m20s"">7:20</a> minutes than I did in my whole semester.
awesome dude
Sir u are great☺
10 dislikes are from the other teachers on youtube who promote their paid classes.
Questions kese ate h sir is topic pr
Precedence graphs of two schedules having the same transactions and same operations are isomorphic. Are they conflict equivalent?
Sir, if we have two adjacent pairs and one pair is non conflict second is conflict. Then , we can swap non conflict or not?
R(A) W(A) and W(A) R(A) are this conflict equivalent
Sir how can r(a) &amp; r(a) be non conflict whereas w(a) and w(a) is conflict??
Thanks a lot !
This guy has single handedly increased my marks in dbms hats off to you, thank you!
Sir i have a doubt .... there  w(a) and r(a) are adjacent conflict pair.. then what happened.?

Very successful sir .
thankyou so much i really enjoy studying with teacher like you, thankyou sir!
Thank u sir u helped me a lot in preparation of my SEM exam
🙏🙏❤❤❤❤🙌🙌
Sir bhagwan ho aap
English😢.... consider south Indian students
just to clarify, if a schedule is conflict serializable it is guaranteed to be serial, right? thank you 😊
Thank you sir 🙏
one of the best explanation
Dhanyavaad ji.
this is very helpful for my exam! thank you sir
Hit like 👍 For SPPU students ❤
Excellent sir. Sir aap marathi ho kya
Finding the serial order is Similar to finding TopoSort using Kahns Algorithm
thank you bro. had an assignment due in four hours and understood nothing about conflict serializability - your video popped up first and saved my life. goat
thanks a lot sir loved the lecture
This dude&#39;s teaching skills are godlike
Nice sir
Nice sir
Nice sir
But sir you are legend.    Seluat sir
Sir inte achhe se collage me agar teachar padata to hm ko exam ke ek din pehle YouTube pe search nhi karna padta
Hi sir <br>How to find number of conflict serializable schedules of given schedule
Never knew Topological Sorting of DAA was used in Conflict Serializability of DBMS!
Sir what a smooth teaching ❤😊
You are saving me I can&#39;t thank you enough 😍😍
thankyou so much. very well explained.
Sharavana
Hats off bhai 🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
Consider the following transactions. Give two non-serial schedules that the serializable:<br>T1<br>T2<br><br>        read (X)<br>X = X+100<br>write (X)<br>read (Y)<br>read (Z)<br>Y = Y + Z<br>write (Y)<br>read (Z)<br>read (X)<br>X = X –Z<br>write (X)<br>read (Y)<br>Y = Y -100<br>write (X)
To be conflict serializable, all transactions should follow?????<br>a) Binary locking<br>b)two phase locking<br>c)binary locking with wait for graph<br>d) None

Very well explained
I was hopeless about DBMS but after watching your videos I regained my hopes. Thank u so much sir👍😊
Best Video On Conflict Serializability !
Mashallah thanks sir 💕💕💕
Sabse pehle T2 ko hi uthalo. Ye dialogue mirzapur wala lag rha thoda thoda.
This is just best lecture ever on the topic..thanks for making such a great vdo..just ads in between are annoying 😅
Awesome!
Fav teacher forever 🙏🙏

Can the precedence graph be bidirectional ?
Thanks a ton sir!!!
bhai meri uni ki fee lele yaqeen krein sara kuch to ap smjhaty ho udhar lakh lakh mein fazool k deri hunnnn
Lol my sir watched this video and is still confused
The method to find the serial order of T1 T2 T3 is basically topological sorting of the graph using bfs method 🙂
thank you🙏❤
Thank you so much sir. You made the concept crystal clear. ❣️
Sir please reply 🙏 <br>Sir jo final answer aaya hai , kya usko hum question ka equivalent schedule bol skte hai. Mean to say &quot;if question aata hai find the  equivalent schedule of the the serialized schedule (taking video question as a question ) , toh kya final answer hi humare question ka answer hoga ..?
Thank you very much Sir. Your all videos are very simple to understand 🙏🙏😄😊
bhai tujhe kitna bhii thanks bol le kam hi h. THANK BROTHER
1 hr before exam 😅 helped a lot!!

Understood sir ❤️
Best video sir, tomorrow is my exam and these videos helped me to understand the topic very well.<br>thank you.
Thanks for the lecture, it was very easy to understand.
thank you sir
Lajawab🙏🙏
Thank you so much sir . I&#39;m glad to tell you that i was little bit nervous about this topic but you have teach this in a very simple manner
Dhasu explanation
King shit
Your videos is simply superb but the thing is if u use English language then it is easy to understand other languagers
You are a Genius in explaining Complex topics very easily 🤌
Superb explanation!
from graph point of view.., the schedule can be serialisable only when the precedence graph is un-directed Acyclic graph..., To find  a  serial schedule we need to find the topological sort of this graph which will respect all the conflicts......<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>

Last m sir &quot;thank u &quot; bol rhe the<br>I was like &quot;thanks to UUUU&quot; ..MERA CONCEPT clear kr diya 😂😂😂 ....thanks to uuu😂😂❤
Sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=10m33s"">10:33</a> the values of conflict serializibilty it will form a loop since w-w also conflict
wheather
First of all A = A-10 is not a write operation it is any READ-&gt;WRITE operation because first old value will be read and then new value will be written. So here example whould be of a blind write for example A= Val <br>Hence your example is faulty @Gate Smashers kindly check this
Sir please upload more videos on view 🙏
Better than my 2 weeks college lecture. Just 15 minutes of awesomeness!! Thank you so much sir for all these videos really helpful!!
Sir, is that so as we have taken the operations before W(A) of T1 and T2 same, so we are getting same output. If we took different, there are different answers. Please help with explanation to that.🙏🙏
Sir I think there is an confusion  at time<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=3m25s"">3:25</a> because you said that if transaction is serialiaza le then it is consistent but sir it will be isolated. So, sir please check and share what is true , thankyou
👍
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=7m44s"">7:44</a> if the operations would have been A+=40 , A*=2, a+=10 then the out put would have been different
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=9m51s"">9:51</a>
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=2m11s"">2:11</a> how t2 and t3 are connect when t3 doesn&#39;t have r(a)
Next view serializability lecture where?
thank you sir tomorrow is my exam
best,you are the best teacher.<br>thank you varun sir...
If the write operation is not subtraction, and if its assignment. i.e. write(x) =&gt; x = some value. Then it wouldnt be view serializable. Right ?
Really Awesome Sir...
at 9.59 time, for w(a) to w(a), t2 to t3  why have u not considered? Then it will form cycle. pl clarify
the only playlist that can save me from the college course!!!
Clear explanation bro 👍👍
Funnily you are the best teacher with the worst cameraman , thank you sir for your wonderful lectures
The vein diagram used for explanation should be corrected as all consistent transactions are not inconsistent, draw an other circle for inconsistent transactions.
<a href=""https://youtu.be/FJteasXARxg"">https://youtu.be/FJteasXARxg</a> -&gt; for second part of view serializability 🙂
❤
Are sir ji maja aa gya
Nice explanation
Sir needed examples of View serializable like how you shown in conflict serializable
On what basis do you swap in view serializability?
But loop To View Wale Option main bhi h
Sir next video about view serializability is missing in the playlist plz help
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=9m53s"">9:53</a> pe Ye jo last me aapne <b>Graph</b> banaya ye bhi to cycle hai?
Awesome Clear concept
I don&#39;t know Hindi well but  I can always count on you. Thank you, sir.
Sir when we are checking view serializability u have swap the position in t1 and t2 respectively but u have told in conflict equivalent video that conflict pairs cannot swap their positions but here u have swap the position so how is that possible
Sir in the view serializability...Transaction T1 reads the value of A as 100 and then updates the value of A by taking its value to be 60. This seems wrong..
Sidhu moosewala ke murder m aap bhi thee kya?
Non serializability Py koi lecture ni mil rha
Great
Sir agr no.of transaction 2 rahe tb KY conflict pair le
Great teacher
Sir theory??????
Sir please make a video on VIEW SERIALIZABLE.. 🙏
Sir view ka or video aaya nhi
Sir jab cycle hoo tab to definately bol askte hai ki woo non serializable hai without checking view serializability ?
Amazing explanation sir !!  The way you convey your knowledge is mind blowing
any new video on view serializability?
Where is the another part of view serializability?🥺
Do they use Optimistic or Pessimistic locks for implementation?
Watching this for my 2nd year exam lol
Wrong concept, W(A) without reading will produce garbage value
Wonderful explanation...
thank u sir !!
I think it is better to write &quot;not a conflict serializable schedule&quot; , rather to write non conflict..<br>If u write &quot;non conflict serializable&quot; , it sounds like a type of serializable
sir your way of teaching is just amazing
Where is the next part...?
bit confused
sir plz upload the remaining parts of view serializable.
doubt: sir pr if trancation do  multiple /division then ye case ye example fail ho jaega na ....
Pls make another  vdo on view serailizable
Thank You 😭😭
Sir plz make a video for cursor ,trigger, procedure, function plz plz plz sir
Sir please add view serializable further video
Sir lecture no.80 nhi mil raha sir
view seriazable working videos also missing :-)
Just to add: <br>If a Transaction is not a conflict serializable.<br>Look for a Blind write.<br><br>Blind write is a must for a view serializable.<br>If a blind write is not available, then it will not be even view serializable.<br><br>Definition of blind write:<br>If a transaction is performing write for a variable without reading the value of a variable, it is called blind write.
best explanation on test for serializibility by far
In both conflict and view  is it possible to get same serialable order...
Sir one doubt if a schedule is conflict means it will be also View or it will be either conflict or view??
Gate Smashers  = Life Saver
Sir please explain more about view serialization 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 as u said u will be making videos on it in this video so please upload it🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thankk you very Much Sir.........
Sir pls solve out my confusion
Sir conflict serializability ko to hum swapping non conflicting pairs Method se bhi calculate kr skte hain. .<br>M I right sir.
Remaining Video on view serializability still not uploaded.
What if transaction 1 fails? How it will be equivalent? could you pls explain...
Everything is fine but video numbers are not cool, like now in the end you will talk about view Seriability but next video didn&#39;t match your words
Very nicely and easily explained
Thankyou sir
Plz add remaining part
Sir but if t1 and t2 have different operation than it will result in different answers
Tomorrow is my DBMS semester exam, wish me luck!
at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=6m41s"">6:41</a> yho write in t1 and taken value if A as 60 but its read operation read the value of A as 100. i am not getting who you took it as 60 intead of 100.
Sir , but here T1 -w(a) &amp; T2 -w(a) pair is a conflict pair !!!! <br>So how did we swap this pair ???
Hello sir... I have a doubt.. How conflict pairs can be swapped?
sir, May you upload the next vedio of reamening part????
SIR LAST ME T2---&gt;T3 pr bhe line aaygi ????
sir <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=6m17s"">6:17</a> pr agar t3 pehle likh de or fir t2 likhe.... i mean meri table apki vali se aho slti h ?us se fir graph bhe different aayga
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=8m40s"">8:40</a> If instead of substracting, we use multiplication for t1 and subtraction for  t2, then they won&#39;t remain view equivalent. Can u elaborate on this one please.
Are you checking for result equivalent insteed of  View Serializability?
Brother at the time <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LKM_RWeroM&amp;t=6m59s"">6:59</a> sec you took A value as 60 in T1 but  the system will take values in its buffer right !? So u have to take A value in T1 as 100 right !!!<br>I&#39;m not saying you are wrong but my teacher learnt me so ,iwho is correct she or you brother. <br>Please reply me !!!
the only video on which i hit like before starting :)"

Is it possible to issue a read lock again to same object when previous read lock is in contact. And there is never release lock mechanism?
Excellent lecture it was sir
sir according to precednce graph transactions are conflict serializable
Thanks sir, very helpful video
No sir <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsqtDD1VriY&amp;t=3m15s"">3:15</a> it is a serializable schedule T1-&gt;T2

Good explanation sir ji 😊❤️
thanks sir.....great explaination
Thanks sir
irrecoverrable or casacadeless ne diff kya h?
No words for explanation! fabulous  sir  keep it up ....
Thank you sir.
thank you so much sir for your kind information
Sir, cascading rollback bhi ho sakta hai esme
jahan pe aap ye prove kar rahe ho ki ye serializable nahi hai, agar usi problem ko precedence graph se solve kia jae to ye serializable hai. Graph mei T1 ki indegree hogi zero. To pehle T1 and fir T2 chalega to ye serializable hai and loop b nahi hoga. ye kese ho sakta hai ?

Full BTECH CAN BE COMPLETED by this channel. Just one channel - 4 year BTech - Done
Excellent explanation with good examples. if you present in English, it will be very useful
Thanks❤
Is bro even talking English?
You saved me ! <br>Legend For real
Sir Explain Multiple mode locking schema and add in this series
Semester k hardly 20 days bache hai <br>Aur hum idhar aye hai concept clear karne <br>Kiun ki college mai to syllabus khatam kia nehi 😅😅
Yrr kya padhate hai ye banda!!!!!
Is he speaking english or?
I wish I could understand indian😢😢😢
Great explaination sir 😊
watching it on 170323, Friday, 05.00 pm
Thanks sir
🥰🥰
Sir Below serializability word <br><br> After X(a) of T1 ,T2 wants S(A)  in such case as you explained ,that T2 of S(A) should wait for unlock of x(a) in T1,but you didn&#39;t mentioned that T2 will be blocked ,<br><br>While in  right side table :<br><br>First t1 has S(a) and after that if in case t2 wants X(a) then you explained that t2 will be blocked (not mentioned wait),so I am getting confused when exclusive lock over shared lock occur or vice-versa lock ,then t2  should wait or blocked
Tomorrow exams in morning 🥺🥲
thank you so much sir!!
Third case m t1 k sth m t2 bhi start horha h beech m..toh serializable hoga?
Thanx ❤
bro speeakin SIMS language. Ty sir
👎🏿😌language problem 👎🏿👎🏿
Where is English?????
Huo matlab kya hota h yrr koi batao<br>Mere me question hai ki explain huo phase locking protocol
Can someone explain how we can apply exclusive lock on D as exclusive lock on B hasn&#39;t been unlocked and According to compatibility table exclusive lock on exclusive lock is not granted<br>It can be granted only when first exclusive lock is unlocked
Bro mixes english with something unknown
perfectly explained<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
After watching several videos i came here and finally understood this topic thanks for making learning easy for us 👍🏻
Thank you sir
thankyou sir
Thankyou sir
bahot accha padha rahe aap sir.....aapka tahe dil sae dhanyvad
Raghav Handoo agar aap yeh exam ke 2hr phele dekh rhe hai toh sojao.........
I am barely can understand what he is saying, and that is very unfortunate taking into account the praising comments down bellow...(
When you don&#39;t speak english why don&#39;t you write it in the title?
I dont understand what this guy is saying
Legit cant figure out if he is speaking english or not
Wow it took me 1 min and 16 seconds to realize he wasn&#39;t speaking english
You have saved my semester whenever I have to study for my ignou exam  first I came to ur channel and  check your playlist if it is present here I am relaxed  thank you so much
You do very good work thank you for free knowledge
Can we write the same explanation for external exams?
Thank you sir because of you I knew 100 marks answer in 100 marks paper,you are greatttt!!!♥️♥️♥️
Ty bhaiya g very overwhelmed by this video no one can explain like u ❣️🙂
You are the perfect sir I have ever know , I like your way of teaching
Sir teach in English also
Great sir
Thank you
Thank you sir ❣️
cannot understand your accent.
T2 Transaction unlocks B?<br>Sir i think it unlocks D.<br>Kindly let me know.
Thanks for explaining 😃
Last one is unlock (D)
Sir plz provide notes for each lecture. It will be more helpful for us.
Waah
V great sir g
the best way to prep or review the subject for me is to put on the Gate Smaschers playlist and skim at 2x speed... <br><br>Efficiencey : 100<br>Constitution : 95
Your videos are good but no one will understand who haven&#39;t watched earlier videos
Sir besides subject i m also getting hindi😁😁...Tq sir
Can you guys consider adding english subtitles??
Very very helpfulll, your teaching skills 👏👌
One tip for those who are new.... &quot;Do not skip&quot;. <br>Content of every second is different and informative.
sahi mais wlh  j&#39;ai compris rien inglizi di ya morssi ???????
Your explanation makes the subject interesting...
Learning full DBMS course from you video<br>Thank you ❤️👍
where have u explained locks
can i read an item(using shared lock) if it has got exclusive lock earlier in the same transaction ??
sir how is this schedule serializable when we have allowed t2 to get shared lock?
Ur teaching skill is awesome just one small confusion. Transaction T2 has never acquired any lock on B then how could it unlock or release the lock on B ?  In T2 column, at the end u have written unlock(B) it must be unlock(D), right? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pUaEDNLWi4&amp;t=8m20s"">8:20</a>
Tq sir
Thankyou sir
Thank you so much sir ❤
Try to explain in English rather than hindi
thank you so much sir. we are ever grateful &lt;3
Jaa rhe h bhaiya tumhare bharose
Thanks 😊
Sir You are the Best ....🙏.Best Teacher
sir Algorithm pr lecture
Thank youu sir jiii❤️<br>You are tooo good!!😊
Hello sir, should we use locks before using read or write operation.
wtf is this language ashahahahha i thought it was english and 3 min into the video it was indian
your perfectly suitable for the pricious word guru.......ji..thanku sir.....the way u connect o the student i liked most
Great Teaching sir.....! I have been learning the whole dbms from u......

wow. You sir are awesome! Thanks
Ur teaching made me fall in love with DMS subject
Your teaching is just amazing 👍
Your teaching style is awesome. U very well know how to connect to student.
Doubt!<br>When shrinking phase of one transaction starts(of let say data item A), can at the same time Growing phase of another transaction starts(where it demands same data item A, for any kind of lock) ?????"

salute to u sir.
sir hamesha bhot accha smjhate hai , ek hi bar me smjh aajata hai, thankyou sir for your hard work.❣❣❣
I think we should say that this schedule is always conflict serializable, but not necessarily serializable
Thank you so much sir❤️
Two persons waiting for each other to text first. <br>That is deadlock 🗿
nice explanation thank you sir
I hv doubt here...unlock ke baad lock grant e nai hoga phr commit krne mein kaise prob ayegi...case 1
Thank u so much ❤️
jo abi yaha tk aa gaya matlab pass ho jao ga itna to ha 🐓🐈
sir in irrecoverability , <br>the T2 transaction is demand for shared lock s(A) when when shared lock we can do only read opertaion so there is no effect on database value of A bcs we are not updating the value we are only reading so how we can say that T2 is not recoverable although if T1 get rolls back there is no problem bcs T2 does nothing write operation in A value .. pls answer
if it is serializable then it should be recoverable also
agar trans 1 mein x(a) firr r(A) , w(A) ho or fir trans 2 mein r(b) ho to r(b) pe to wo lock lg sakta hai tp fir serializibilty to nhi hoga
Mind blowing
Thanku sir
I love you
Sir aapka lecture dekhne se phle like nhi kru to sukoon nhi milta and I feels like I cheated you so first i like then i love to watch lecture ❤️
Very nice explained
We can rollback commited transaction through campanstate transaction 👍 Isn&#39;t it?
very good explanation
Your explanations are just perfect 😊
his teaching skills are pro, but did you all notice his sweatshirt collection very cool :p
I am from Pakistan. May Allah give you best reward for providing ease to the students.... please teach the teachers here how to teach. they have no idea how to teach students. lots of respect for you and best wishes....
Thankyou sir
Thankyou sir
Sir, GATE exam ke liye swiching Theory ke uper videos banao na sir.
Amazing !!I found another great teacher on utube.  Also, I did not understand one thing why it is called 2PL? And 2PL and serializability r same things or different? Also, To solve transaction issue in microservice architecture people uses 2PL. can u ellaborate how that work?
Sir cascade schedule can also recoverable. If I am wrong then tell me sir
Thanku sir. I always watch your video. You inspire me  as a YouTuber also because I am also a YouTuber. And want to become a teacher like you . Love you sir.
Hey , I really appreciate this ,  It was so hard to feel the concept from the reference book . Thank you so much for helping us out !
Thank you sir ☺️
Sir compensating transaction se roll back kiya ja sakta hai, commited transaction ko
U r awesome... U tube pr only u .......who have cleared my all doubts ...thanks
I can&#39;t understand your language sir please try to teach in English it would be very helpful to other students from other languages
All your videos are very useful and clear Sir!
Nice sir❤️
ap jaisa sir kiu sirf youtube me parat hai...clg mai kiu nahi ate aap jaise teacher...
Sir,shared exclusive me bhi to fer cascading rollback hoga fer.....
Very nice explanation ... i used to be a biology student but i took engineering line, i nvr studied computer based subjects even my teachers failed to explain thm to me but you ..... you are like a light spot in my black world ..... keep it up plz upload more subjects realated to it stream
Paji ek number 👍
Great sir👌👌
You are great sir. I very much love you sir!!! &lt;3
example  on css but not 2pl
Sir, why is cascading rollback said to be a &#39;disadvantage&#39;?
best videos . Keep the good work up :)
Amazing 👌👌 👌

Thank you so much sir ! Your lectures are really helpful
Thank you so much sir
Please present in English.Your explanation is too good and easy to follow.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Yqn91akV8&amp;t=11m10s"">11:10</a>  If t1 given all resources and t2 is left emplty then it should be like t2 shouldnt wait for t1 but you are saying t1 to wait for t2. Why to wait since it has all resources and not giving any resources to t2.
Yahi example bar bar bata rahe   hai sir dura example bhi bataye  🤔👈👈👈
The &quot;Best&quot;
Thank you Sir
May be in rigorous  2pl the starvation not  possible because   until the commit/aborted the lock of SHRED  even not released .<br>So,if  T2 acquired the S(A)  and few time later  T1 want to X(A) so wait  also  after few time T3 want to S(A)  but T3 come Later compared to T1 and Rigorous lock says never unlock S &amp; X lock before  commit /aborted . <br>Both are in waiting state . When T2 unlock (A)  then  according to 1st preferred  T1 complete its operation by acquired  X(A) lock
Sir deadlock pe ek video banao na please
Thank you so much ❤️
Tomorrow is my final paper of dbms and I&#39;m watching your videos since morning
Sir is topic ke notes bhi send karo na plz..
This channel is like gold mines for engineer student and has no end. Every topic explained step by step .... Thank you sir
Isn&#39;t starvation getting removed by rigorous 2Pl?
Thank you so much for the clear explanation.
this guy in legend.
A huge respect love and thanks from Pakistan. You made our university life easy keep it up we will support you ❤
👌🏻👍
Can anyone tell why we use rigourous 2PL if it isn&#39;t providing anything new?
Great explanation
sir shared lock is not compatible om exclusive lock but you gave it while explaining in example 1
Dbms is so easy just because of you sir😇🙏
👏👏👏👏
Everything is fine but would have loved to see the kind of questions that come from each topic.
for startvation if t2 has s(a) and t1 asking for x(a), then t1 has to wait but in rigorous 2pl we cannot even give s(a) to t3 then how there is any problem of starvation??
thank you sir i am watching complete playlist of dbms and after completion of it I will complete os and networking and ds also. i will also like to see opps concept and c language if you provide video on it. fully enjoying your videos.
Sir tb to ye bilkul exact serial schedule hi ho gaya....Waiting increases--throughput decreases--performance decreases
By now I made it till Lec-84 with making notes in every slides. This guy is a gem. Ultra God level teaching. Even the complex concepts of DBMS is explained with so ease that his explanation will never let you get stuck anywhere in the middle. Awesome. Thanks brother. Love you a ton.
Your all videos is upto the mark
Thanks sir very much
Wonderful explaination sir... Fast and to the point.  Extremely appritated 👌👌👍👍
U r the best sir💫🥰
Who will take admission if sir start his collage ?
how is so u r so genious
Thank you very much sir
Sir in previous video u told exclusive lock is unlocked for T1 before giving shared lock to T2 and explained furthur transaction T1 continues but here u said exclusive lock for T1 is unlocked after commit only.
Thankyou sir
Preparing for GATE 2022😉
I think<br><br>Strict 2PL =&gt; Cascadeless, Recoverable<br>Rigorous 2PL =&gt; Cascadeless, Recoverable, Starvation free<br>Conservative 2PL =&gt; Cascadeless, Recoverable, Starvation free, Dead Lock free
I am watching ur video all non-stop..great work sir
Thank You so much Sir 🙏
Thanks a lot sir I m watching the whole playlist non-stop
Great explanation sir👍
Very helpful sir 👍
U r great sir, good xplanation
Sir I had a doubt. If Rigorous 2PL helps in removing starvation problem??
Sir, 1 doubt.......i think Starvation problem is solved in rigorous 2PL, as if any Resuorce is in shared lock and another transaction requests for exclusive lock, then it is put onto wait condition, but at same time if any other transcation requests for shared lock it was granted in other PL&#39;s bcoz of which starvation was occuring but in Rigorous 2PL it would not allow even Shared lock to take place, so starvation problem also gets eliminated? correct?
But sir in case of rigorous 2pl.  Shared lock sud hold until commit...but in case of starvation eg u said b4 commit of t2 t3 took s(a)???
thank you, sir, but I have one doubt you said Conservative 2PL will solve the deadlock issue as one transaction will acquire all the locks so if T2 comes then it won&#39;t be able to get access to locked resources so isn&#39;t it a deadlock/ starvation as T2 is still waiting for T1 to end.
A.o.a sir g rigorious 2pl men hm shared ky oper shared locks dy sakty han ya nh qkh as men to shared aur x locks dono nh deny before c agr hm na dn to starvisin possible nh aur agr dn to h rigorious ki definition to follow nh hoti
Awesome sir 🙏🙏🙏
Ekdam Clear Sir Ji
The best
you are best
suggestion : just make two videos instead of switching languages back and forth
i have an question, in case of deadlock according to rigorius  2pl if t2 get shared lock,and t1 waits with exclusive lock for commitment of t2. And before t2 commits t3 wants shared lock on A.But  according to rigorius  2pl  it should also wait  for commitment of t2. .So after t2 gets commited who will get access to  A, T1 or T2?if u please kindly tell this answer.
Good evening sir..... Awesome explanation.... But please clear my one doubt.... In case of rigorous 2PL... If t2 transaction get shared lock on A and after some time t1 want exclusive lock on A.... and same time t3 need shared lock on A...Nd after some time t2 committed.... Which transaction will get lock first... Hope u understand my query
Such a wonderful explanation
Us k Bary me questions kesy aty hen sir?
Sir I think , in regours 2p lock  method will prevent from starvation because the lock is  given after the commit<br>Can u clarify my doubt sir <br>Beside this awesome vedio sir 🌹<br>Thank u💞💞🌹🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Thank you Sir. Your videos are really easy to understand and remember. Sir Please upload video on Strict Timestamp Ordering and Thomas&#39; s Write Rule. Thank you.

outstanding explanation ....very nice...thank you sir😇
Best explanation thank you😄
Wrong explanation using example
Sir why did u not uploaded graph and tree  based protocols ...? Also not uploaded deadlock in dbms 😑
You look like lawrance bishnoi
But many of the sources say, &quot; Highest becomes rts and wts, not the latest&quot;
Thankyou so much sir
<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>tomoroow is exam...
Sir it is used for conflict data we gave unique name later
Really high appreciation for such easiest explaination
You have wrtiten wrong timestamp. The Write TIme Stamp will be 30 instead of 20.

Validation based protocol in dbms video link snd kr dy plzzzz... Meri presentation hai
Time stamp is assigned to all transactions or just to conflicting transactions?? if its all, then concurrency is not achieved.
then how concurrency is achieved
It was really helpful to me because none of the material said this much clear <br><br>Thank you so much 🥰
you are great and you describe great and complete but I don&#39;t know Hindi , so I miss a big part of description
Want in English
But in case 2 t1 is committed so who that can be rollback
love is explanation makes things soo simple ,thank you sir .
Thankyouuuuuu❤💯

Could you plz make a video on thomas write rule .i don’t understand why we ignore write operations.I don’t find any other Video which explains better than you
Awesome sir👍
Wow, sir! Nice explanation. A funny way to interpret is if you have a girlfriend, and ex comes don&#39;t give her any chance xD xD
Sir Thomas write rule ka video nhi hey kya
Youngest one have Largest timestamp, so how was wts() = 20 at that example?<br>Time stamp and time stamp numbers are same or different Concept?
un-fucking-believable
Sir please remind us to like the video at end too bcoz generally we do it at end.<br>And also increase the end part so we get time to like it.
Thankyou sir
Thank you it really helped me 😊
I can understanding little bit ...but i don&#39;t knw Hindi ...i like to study with ur teaching pls upload  in English sir ..please
voli adms vayera dimaag ma kei nachireko csit students esso comment garam na
Sir, you said that we need to take time stamp value higher than the before one... But in write time stamp you took lesser value for T2 and you said wts=20 ,why?
bestest video ever in this topic
Thank you sir for this amazing explanation 🙏
Sir thank you soo much for free education....m dame sure ill pass my dbms sub now

GATE 2021 anyone?
Thank you so much Sir, for providing such great content to us.<br> I&#39;ve one doubt. I read that Timestamp Ordering (TO) is sometimes unrecoverable due to the dirty read problem. But In TO the older will always commit before the younger then how will this ever be unrecoverable?
Very nice explaination Sir👍

Maast Explanation
Thank you sir!!
best explanation on Timestamp  based protocols rules , It is not straight forward concept to understand by studying rules .<br>Thanks sir
thanks sir.<br>ur all videos are awesome.
What a great great great Explanation. Salute You Sir:) Well, I got one doubt here. Let suppose T1 is older and T2 is younger. Now, T1 is having first Write(x) transaction and later T2 is having Read(x) and no matter there would be more transaction. But, what will happen if the T1 gets aborted in future. (It seems like T2&#39;s Read(x) has read wrong information.)
Last example W(A) in T2 and W(A) in T1 on both transactions... Why should it rollback... In 2nd rule 2b it fails... Doesn&#39;t it as WTS(A) is not greater than TS(Ti) and they are equal to 100.

Here, T1-R(A) and T3-W(A) is conflicting but we are allowing them, so what about consistency of schedule. May be it&#39;s RW conflict.

100 gretaer than 100 ye roll back kyu nj hua
Thank yous sir, much love from ethiopia...I love your energy, how you explain everything in detail without jumping and explaining everything repeatedly in a simple manner🥰
The point of rollback of older transaction in following rules due to early transaction operations forces the older transaction to start again with higher time stamp,which means the older transaction overall time coming to the system will be more than younger transaction which I think is no point of doing.
best explanation! hats off man!
Deadlock
OMG thank you sir Thank you.......Thank you for teaching us...I don&#39;t know why I am giving all my Father&#39;s money to these colleges. GOD knows.
Thanku sir for all your time and efforts for uh...very grateful to uh😇

Thankyou bhaiya, wonderfully explained...😘
Thankyou bhaiya
Best explanation of this concept<br>Thank u so much Sir for your videos.
I am wondering who are those 14 people who disliked this video. This is one of the best video about this concept on Internet.I loved it😍😍
Is the first rule is known as thomas write rule....anyone?
greatly explained
This is how a complex concept is made easy. <br>Just amazing 👌👌👌
Sir,I just want to know due to property of atomicity when we rollback T2 don&#39;t other other transactions will be rollback
questions..?!!!!!
I am not getting word&#39;s to thank you sir! You are really amazing thank u for helping me in this covid situation sir

I cannot thank you enough. You are amazing the way you explained the indexing concepts in the series.🙏
Since you have considered data is sorted and in one block<br>TC : O(log2n)<br>so, indexing can&#39;t be better than binary search
Sir blocks 10 hoga na

How much you drag? Previous video also covered same thing and in this video also same.. Each sentence u repeat 100 times.. 🙄
You are the best, I wish you are my university teacher!!!! you are saving our lives, Thank you so much!!!
i have been watched some of  videos in DBMS playlist and i must say the way gate smashers clears the conept in depth and with absolute clarity

good numerical and explanation both
The way he took the log out just by looking at the number damn 🔥
Sir you say ki humei hard disk se ram mei block ko lana padta hai, what if computer shuts down then toh data permanently delete toh hoga nahi. Toh can we say that block ko laya nahi jata balki uski copy lai jaati hai ram mei?
when he showed the book in video.. everything made sense. I liked his approach to practical demonstration.
Thankyou sir
Sir , awesome...First time I m watched such a complex topic with so ease and better explanation. Your now big fan from Pak...you are serving humanity..Thanks
Which database book u introduced in this vedio?
I have one doubt. You said we can apply binary search if records are sorted, but physically they are in HD and to apply binary search we first need to bring the block into the RAM, then how does it reduce the NO. of disk-reads??
Some are born to serve mankind...! You are one of them. Thanks a lot, Sir.
Thanks🌹🌹🌹
Thankyou 🤗
I think ..I can get a good AIR in gate by watching your videos sir ☺️♥️

isnt this technically searching for blocks and not records?
Thank YOU Very Much Sir.
The way you explain every topic with the help of scenarios and examples is awsome and simplify every complexity.

God bless you and keep doing this amazing work. Greetings and love from San Francisco, California.
Hi. Need one clarification. Isn&#39;t the worst case cost should be 10000 ms. Because each block processing time is 4 ms and there are 2500 blocks so reaching at the last block will take 10000 ms
your all videos are very helpfull....i request u to can u provide video on computer oriented numerical method subject

Please add dense and sparse indexing also in title. This will help students who will come in future.
Masallah your explanations is excellent ❤❤❤
Index table me Binary search kaise apply ho raha hai. Please explain
you do a great job, thanks a lot sir
can we store the index as a hashmap? then the searching would be constant and not logn.
Just amazing, how much effort this guy has put in, you have literally saved CSE engineers not going to lie sir...
thanks for sharing your tremendous knowledge with us
how come sir, we are using binary in case of Dense as it is unordered it will have normal liner search?
For those who are having doubt and think in dense it should be 200 + 1: Keys in the index table are arranged in order to make it easier to search the records, so that we can use binary search. Hence lg(200) + 1
sir can u please explain why have u added extra plus 1 to search a record in a block in indexing search where as in last lecture video in binary search of n =2500 (here n is number of blocks ) we got log2^n =12 where u haven&#39;t added plus 1 but in this case also we do search for block   and after getting that particular block we should search of particular record only .
Excellent Explanation... Hats Off to your efforts...
superb
Brilliant lecture.
thank you sir
why log(200)+1 in case of dense searching as data is unordered in index table..it should be avg of 200+1, right?
Bhai ye underrated video hai, most important I can say
I think there is some mistake in dense index table because you said we are scanning in each pages of page table after doing binary search but if we are not able to find the required page in that block then where we need to go because data is sored in unordered fasion.
Nice explanation sir
Too good😍
He is a true genius. None can deny that
Thank you Sirji, very well explained, and understood, I have subscribed and have recommended to friends too.
It&#39;s amazing sir.Your videos are always up to the mark and help me a lot .There is no other coaching classes required .All the doubts are  always clear here .😀😃😃
Why we chose 50 in log2 it should be 250 because ,250 is total no of indexes entry
Even in sparse we have to search in all 50 blocks then again for 50 entries
@Gate Smashers  I have a doubt on Sparse. As per the given question in this video, for sparse index there will be total of 50 blocks in the index. What if my search result is in the 50th block? So, the RAM will be searching 50+1=51 blocks to get the record rite? I am not understanding the concept of 6+1=7 total searches. Could you kindly explain?
Excellent sir
* In dense , why 1 is added *  as in sparse it require further search in page but in dense it have all records.
Sir, your videos are just awesome. Please keep it up.
Are we ignoring the time required to find the correct block of the index table?
simplicity in one word &quot;superb&quot;
sir first you are saying dense indexing is used when data is unordered . so why at last you are doing binary search on record and giving ans as log(200) + 1, ans should be 200 in this case acc to me . Please help me to clear this doubt please.
Sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_S_MpLoDEM&amp;t=10m27s"">10:27</a> log200 base 2 value is not 8 but it is 7.64
can anyone explain me that why we take the size of index block same as that of hard disk block ?? why not different ??
Sir I have a question you said when it&#39;s unordered we&#39;re using dense but when ordered we&#39;re using sparse but in both sparse and dense we&#39;re taking time complexity of logN which is used in the case of binary search but binary search can be used only for ordered then how can we use binary search in case of dense which is already unordered?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_S_MpLoDEM&amp;t=10m27s"">10:27</a> Why we are calculating the log2 (200) as we are using dense and records are unordered and cant use binary search.
i am bit confused...<br>for dense will the unordered data be stored in ordered form in index pages?
i think searching time in DENSE index should be O(200)+1 rather than log(200)+1 ?
DOUBT - log(50) gives the corrosponding block and not  the index for next block<br>we need log(50) * log(50)  ( or log(2500) better )to get index from index table
Ur teaching style is fantastic.....i loved it.....plz make videos on Ugc net unit 1 (discreet structure and optimization)
Hello sir,  in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_S_MpLoDEM&amp;t=8m59s"">8:59</a> how can we get a block in log2(50), when each block of index itself contains 50 blocks of hard disk ( in case of spars ) rather we get bulk of 50 blocks and to get the required block we have to again binary search in that block of index therefore to get the required block we have to search again log2(50) after this we will get successfully our required block, therefore total time complexity of searching in index is log2(50) + log2(50) which is log2(2500), and after this time we will again search our required record in that particular block.<br>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, and thank you sir for this amazing series.
For Dense shouldn&#39;t it be O(n) because of linear search? We can&#39;t apply binary search here.
In dense indexing we can directly go the record why it will be log200 if data is unordered ?? Please verify last part of the video
I have a doubt about the case of Dense. In the case of Sparse, the data is ordered and there we can apply the binary search but in the case of unordered(Dence) the data in the Index table is also not sorted in such case we can&#39;t apply the binary search. <br><br>I think in dense case it should be N ( which is 200 in the example case which is far less than 2500 earlier and far efficient).<br><br>I might be wrong. Please correct me in case I&#39;m wrong.<br><br>Thanks
log(200) cant be done in unordered it should be 200/2=100 for unordered i.e. dense
I think there is a mistake in the end part of the video when I/O cost is being said for dense entry. Since it is unordered, there will be no concept of binary search, so it should be 200 searches in index table and 1 search for the corresponding hit in the index table. === (200 +1). And the average answer will be 200/2 = 100.
Good Lecture Sir :)<br>Having one doubt here :<br>without indexing, we are not considering searching inside a page, only I/O operation is considerable.=&gt;fine<br>with indexing =&gt; when unsorted =&gt; not considering searching inside a index page =&gt; log200 + 1 =&gt;fine=&gt;<br>because here we have to find the right page pointer.<br><br>with indexing =&gt; when sorted =&gt; we have to consider searching inside an index page also because that&#39;s the only thing which gives us right  DB page =&gt;<br>so here time will be log50(searching right  page among 50 pages) + log50(searching right record among 50 records) +1 <br><br>Please correct me, if I made any mistake here.
The Book analogy was an eye opener. Great explanation!
simply awesome !!!!! The way of explaining is superb, Thanks!
Thankyou sir
Would Search complexity of dense be same as sparse which is( log 2 n)but dense is for unsorted data so why we use binary search for dense sir.Thankyou sir
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_S_MpLoDEM&amp;t=10m44s"">10:44</a> whty are we taking log(200) the data is unordered so avg time should be 200/2 = 100 or simply O(no. of index blocks) ?
Thank you sir
This man deserve more view and more likes ... thank you so much sir for saving our future
for sparse indexing when we find the block, then we again need to search 4 records with in that block soo the worst case for sorted records is will be (log50)+log(4)=7.64~8. Not 7 as mentioned. Also in dense case we can&#39;t apply log because the data is unsorted in dense.
In dense indexing the records are un ordered then how can we use binary search
Sir aapka bahut bahut shukriya mere DBMS pakka krne ke liye 🙏🔥
sir....thanks a lot !

Is this type of questions important for gate?
Thank you!!!
Today I cracked my viva due to your all lectures on dbms , really i thankful to you 🙆‍♀️ sir
I have never ever ever ever ever...seen a techer like you...🙏☺️ Sir ji
Sir, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_S_MpLoDEM&amp;t=9m09s"">9:09</a> it should be [log50] + [log4] = 8, as there are 4 records(sorted) in each block.
The way you explain things, so far the best I&#39;ve come across. Thank you for saving my time and I don&#39;t feel pressurised at all while learning rather it feels great!! Big shoutout to this channel!!
Sir mein sirf apki videos follow kar Raha hai ye videos comptetive exams ke liye sufficient hai .

unordered portion is wrong. please give an update
index table operating system ka page table jesa hua
yeh ek accha video hai
Sir Plz take a class about RAID
Sir,as you said dense is for unordered data so in that case time complexity should be of O(n) but why u did log200+1, according to concept it must be 200+1 due to linear search for unordered data.
Thank You So Much Sir
Sir, Thankyou for the best lecture videos, Your teaching skills are above the level, from that elementary class students can also understand the same.<br><br>Sir but i hv 1 doubt:  At Duration(in Video): <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_S_MpLoDEM&amp;t=9m10s"">9:10</a><br>u said that we have to search 6 + 1 . But when we approached to M.memory then why are adding 1 search only for it, as within the blocks there are no. of records(In our case its 4). Please tell me ??
Thank you sir👍
Bhaiya just wanted to know, are entries in Index Table always sorted?

Sir I&#39;ve a doubt.. U told in dense for each record there is an entry in index table. So directly we will get page no. Wat is the need of searching in HD block.  Log 200 is enough.. No need of +1.
👌👌👌👌👌💕💕
Sir, in case of mapping in dense indexing, all the 10000 records that get mapped into all the 200 index table blocks would still be UNORDERED. Thus, traversing them would require a time complexity of O(n) rather than O(log n), as in the index table we would need linear search, don&#39;t you think? Please comment.
Sir u r really doing great job. Ur smile starting from video and after giving so much effort you end video with smile . It&#39;s really spread positive vibes.....Thank u for teaching us...
dense main +1 nahi aye ga aor log 2 200 nahi aye ga keun k data sorted nahi he. baki you did well. keep doing
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_S_MpLoDEM&amp;t=10m42s"">10:42</a>
Sir, I guess <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_S_MpLoDEM&amp;t=8m30s"">8:30</a> ko it should be 1 instead of log2(50) because all 50 entries are in a single block.
sir pls a make on a vedio of past year ugc net exam..
When indexes are used in unordered form, then why it is taking log form.?
nice explanation
Dense me log +1 kuyn, + 1 to nahi chahiye na? ptr per record to hain hi, phir hard disk me kuyn search kare?
Sir, thank you so much for the video. It explains indexing clearly and very informative.
excellent explaination
Dear sir indexing in your 3 lectuers are 101% clear but plzzzzzzzzzz explain b tree and b+tree and as well as hashing topic......"

Simple and fast
Hello Sir, Thank you so much for the sharing the knowledge you have with whole hearted. <br>I have one doubt here. What are non-clustered index. Is it same as Secondary index. Please explain Sir.
Explained in seconds great explanation sir😌
Ek type batana bhul gye sir aap. Already Software Engineer ho, but DB Indexing na aati ho, woh bhi isse dekhen.
Is Unique index and primary index is same???
In sparse index after reaching a block we need to search in that block . So how that searching is 1? 🤔
reached till  90

Sirrrr..... Keep You Are Best ❤️ More Power to You
Ur videos just amazing 👍bhai
I have been working in the software industry from last 3 and half years, I was very confused with indexing, I know how it works but only in theoretical manner but the way you have explained is fabulous and the numerical which you solved is great . Great job man. I recommend this channel to colleges student.

Awesome  , you are great sir 👌👌🙏🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳
Bhai, you are the best. Love you❤
Sir multi level indexing???
Your vedio is osm sir 😊😊
good way of Teaching
why dont you speak in english so that some of us who are not indians can understand too?is this meant for indians only? i suggest your write the title in hindi or whatever language you are speaking in so that we dont waste time to click things we dont understand
Physical ordering is same as logical ordering with uniqueness then its primary index
plz give lecture on concerncy control...
Awesome keep it up bro :)
<b>Thanks Varun, super trick to understand indexing👍👍</b>
Your videos are so good and amazing. The more i watch, the more i get amazed. You take your time to go through the steps which shows your dedication towards teaching. I have utter respect for you. Thank you. Keep the good work up.

sir where is the link for dense and sparse
Sir, The way u explained is awesome❤
Best for last night study😅😅😊❤
Sir<br>Primary key table me lagane se ye kaise decide hota hai ki db ordered file hai..? If ye ordered nhi to primary index kaise create hota hai..?
THANKS SIR ALLAH PAK BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AMEEN
Thanks 🙏🙇
Don&#39;t know about dbms but now i sure know about indian railways
where sparse and dense lec?
I have a confusion...in case of sparse index when we search the block of index table, don&#39;t we need to search the record in it to find the location of the block in hard disk provided that the index table contains a anchor key and not the actual key of record
Fun fact : Sir I usually watch your videos in 1.25x speed so , when I watch your videos in 1x speed then I think I&#39;m in a slow motion world. 😂🤭
This is brilliant.. The best part is, explaining the time complexity to showcase, how indexes would make things faster.. Awesome..
Best explanation 👌
Wooowww mann 🙏🙏🙏
He is like jeetu bhaiya for us ❣️❣️  whoever agrees like it 🎉🎉🎉
Thank you so much sir aapne bahut hi achchhe se iss concept ko samjhaya WO bhi bahut hi kam samay me
I have followed the indexing series. Very well explained and you have quality which will make viewers stick to the video till the end.
I couldn&#39;t find sparse and dense indices video
very good explanation sir . thanku soo much for ur vedios .
The best
Thankyou sir 😊. Understood
well done gentleman its great to watch and listen to the logical flow of these things, keep it up mate
can the &quot;key&quot; contain null values on which primary index is applied?
Good explanation but I don&#39;t think the complexity is Log(2)N for sparse index here because the disk head doesn&#39;t have the address of middle value while doing a binary search, it has to go through each and every entry in the index table. So the complexity is O(n) where n is the number of blocks in sparse index. lets say if u want to go to entry 5, how does the disk head go to 5 directy unless we have the address of 5 in sparse index stored again? It is going to be sequential access. That&#39;s why O(n)
Non Clusterd index kia hn plz
Why it is log2n?
I feel that the search time should depend on number of blocks in hard disk and not number of blocks in Index table. This is because even if the index table is sorted, you will have to perform binary search on the Keys and not on the block address of index table and the number of keys is equal to the number of blocks in the disk.<br><br>So, log2N + 1, where N = Number of blocks in the disk.<br><br>On second thought, are you trying to say that while doing binary search, you will just check the starting Key of each index table block for comparison and not each and every key?
All my CSE subjects at one place. Thank you Sir. Very clear explanation.
nicely explained!!
Shouldn&#39;t the time for finding the row be (log2N)^2 ?
Sir u r best teacher..I want to join your class..i completed B.A. (Arts) in Marathi language.. I m learning IT syllabus.. I m  interested in IT job..so can get job in IT field... It&#39;s my dream job.. I want to work on Application and  production support engineer..so sir pls give me some suggestions 🙂
I have a doubt sir when you said primary index have key values why do we have non unique primary index and unique primary index
When sir say ek value aahygi, with  his index finger it look like bahubari..<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E-MGnjMhRw&amp;t=2m45s"">2:45</a>

During this corona time i took admission in MCA and being from a non computer background i was too depressed because i couldn&#39;t understand anything during online classes<br><br>But now MCA have been interesting to me<br>All thanks to you sir
Very Nice Explanation Sir😊
Soon i will complete this series 👍🙌
Nice explanation as always...❤️ <br>Almost completed playlist...easy explanation and nice efforts...keep it up sir..!!😀
Tq
Nice explanation😊
Very nice explanation
Sir, when we got block then whether we are returning whole block to ram or only single record to ram?
Primary index is a sparse index,complexity is log2n+1
i don&#39;t understand how uniqueness resembles with key value.Let&#39;s say i have nos from 1 to 100  and they are unique and sorted then whats  the key-value?<br><br>Ok so he means we can form key using these values.
Sir agr me serch kru 3 toh ye kaise work krega

I think we will categorize clustered index as dense index
App grate facility h pure duniya me sir❤😢
Sir a little stumbled in log2+1... actually what is the 1 using for ???

Please have an video of lock types
Primary Index: A primary index is a type of index that is created on the primary key of a table. It ensures the uniqueness of the primary key values and typically results in a clustered index. The primary index provides efficient access to specific rows based on the primary key values.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note that different database systems may have variations in terminology and implementation details.
Index: An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It works like an index in a book, allowing the database to quickly locate specific rows based on the values in one or more columns.<br><br>Dense Index: A dense index contains an entry for every record in a table, with each entry pointing directly to the corresponding record. It enables efficient retrieval of individual records but can be resource-intensive due to its larger size.<br><br>Sparse Index: A sparse index contains entries for only some of the records in a table, typically at regular intervals. It requires fewer resources compared to a dense index, but retrieval may involve multiple disk accesses.<br><br>Clustered Index: A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. In other words, the rows in a table with a clustered index are stored on disk in the same order as the index. Each table can have only one clustered index, and it provides fast retrieval when querying data in the order defined by the clustered index.
I thought we dont need any intemediate table for clustered index
Excellent 💯
Where does the value of block hanker get stored or how it is stored? In the Index table, somehow?
what if I donot search on the basis of primary key? then how does clustered index provide benefits?
ASSALAM.U.ALAIKUM THANKS SIR ❤️ ALLAH PAK BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND ALLAH PAK GIVE YOU EVERYTHINGS YOU WANT AMEEN
ok
your example are always be unqiue and with lots of use case appreatiable
sir aap punjabi ho?
since we are storing hashed key why it will be log N it should be O (1)
Why is it called clustered ?
Subtitle distracted me
The PTO example. Another level of explanation.
Sir, As per my view primary index also know as clustered index and secondary index also known as non-clustered index.
Woow Sir, you&#39;ve cleared my concept, thank you so much Sir.
Thanks alot 🙌
sir, while creating cluster in mysql, can we choose which type of indexing( primary, cluster, secondary) we want to use?
Amazing sir
Hello Sir, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpJ9ICmzaAM&amp;t=6m22s"">6:22</a>  time of the video you specified if you want then you have have more then one clustered index in table with the reason that we don&#39;t create because in one table we don&#39;t more than 1 primary key but as per my understanding the reason should be if we will have more than 1 clustered index then we will not be able to determine the order of an clustered index. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong ?
Why it is log2n???
Brilliant :)
very good explanation
Thanks sir
Thankyou sir
You can write in HINDI in the video title..!!
Ur english comments is covering ur diagrama.
Can you explain with query / syntax .? It will lot more helpful.
Block Hanker or Block Anchor?
Sir there is no concept of dense and sparse in clustered indexing
Block hanker or block anchor?
Bro ur videos are soo simple and easy to understand bro tqs ... U made my dbms subject 😎easy. 🙂
sir, sometime u told that u can create more than one PI/CI but no need to do. and sometime u told that u can create atmost 1. <br>sir can u plz elaborate??
Great😊
For Primary Index, when we are saying the data has to be sorted? are we referring to the data of the Primary Key column or we are referring to all the data available in the table?
Your video very helpful for me to make a bright future ❤️
Amazing all clear
What is  N in log 2 (N) + 1? It was mentioned that it would be the # of blocks in Index Table, but shouldn&#39;t it be # of blocks in Hard Disk, since it was mentioned that in sparse, N would be the # of blocks in Hard Drive and for dense, it would be the # of records in Hard Drive?
Hi pls share cluster index syntax? Good explanation 🙏
Thanks Nice Teach But let Us know About Non Clustered Index
<a href=""https://youtu.be/UpJ9ICmzaAM?t=218"">https://youtu.be/UpJ9ICmzaAM?t=218</a> is not &quot;Black Hanker&quot; - Its &quot;Block Anchor&quot;. Verify on google...
Sir if we don&#39;t use the block hanger and simply take the value from one block only and same data is not in another block so time complexity will remain same as primary index ...ie log2n plus 1 ...plz tell sir and thnks for this video👍
thnkss alott ji...god bless u forever..
Sir please make videos on types of hashing
Kamal ka explanation Bhai
Sir cluster failover ka video banaiye. Jo ki kali ya SentOS  par kaam kare
Amazing Sir<br>love from pakistan
Sir description me related links bhi diya kijiye please, mujhe primary key ka video mil nhi raha aapka
Sir..clustered m donu sparse and dense indexing arahi h..bcox dense in the sense that all records are getting entry in the sorted order..and sparse that for multiple one&#39;s..single 1 is taken
what if there are all the unique values in cluster key.....then it will be work as a dense index??
The Nicest Explaination that any one can ever find in the internet.
Hi... could you also make a video on multilevel indexing, b tree, b+ tree etc etc
Sir thoda confusion hai ...Apne btaya complexity is log N or isme N = no of blocks in index table ....But index table mai to block hai hi nahi ...Yah No of record in index table hona chhaiye ...Plzz reply if I am wrong ...Or kaha galati Kar raha hu mai ....Thanku this wonderful teaching ..
Thanks Sir.

Would the intermediate layer have a single block for all entries? Is it necessary that all entries fir a particular name fit in a single block
Sir Please add Question in this Playlist ... Question should be based on the concept of Priamry  INdex, Secondary Indexing .... Clustered Indexing
One small dought sir...<br>You told that size of blocks in harddisk and index table are same know... But u consider different. Can u explain that once. <br>Because tommorow is my exam

Sir ,ham primary key, foreign key toh SQL mein practically laga dete Hein, kya hum primary index,clustered index, secondary SQL mein lagate he, ya zaroorat nahi padati ????
Thanks a lot sir  ji
I&#39;ve a question on the time complexity here - Are we saying the time complexity to search for an entry using primary index and secondary index are same because we are not considering the time to sort the element to create the index or am i missing something ? Please help
Nice one.. looking for this for a while and finally got it.. I&#39;ve a question though , you can call it a dumb question , still, i would ask - Should a primary index always be created using primary key? For example, in your table , can&#39;t i create a primary index on PAN number if my application has a search option on PAN number ?
sirji 3 din se iske upar padh padh ke dimaag kharab ho gya tha, Finally aapke video se samajh me aaya.
Sir aap sirf bolte ho particular topic ki video discription mai dunga lekin kisi bhi video mai particular topic ki link ki nahihe . Although the Content is GREAT.
Epic
If it weren&#39;t for your videos. I&#39;d have been struggling with dbms so much since the university books are so confusing.
Loved it
Sir you didnt explaining hashing ?
Employee ID looks like our Eid😄😄
I like your videos but , can you explain practically in coding?.. because the main issue occurs during the coding. I hope you understand my point.
People say online lectures lead to unresolved doubts , but over here as soon as the doubt arises , your words come in &quot; agar yaha iski jagah yeh hotah &quot; and it clears it all . Thank you for being my 2AM teacher
the secondary index table will have a pointer to the primary key. not to the Disk. <br>if we query by Pan or name we do binary search on secondary index. from that we get the primary index. using primary index we scan primary index and then get data from HD.
Block alag see banakar memory waste hogi. If you have a non-unique key then store every  memory pointer for that particular key in index table only. Simple
ircc🔥
sir plz tell me what is non clustred index
great
iske jaisa vdo pure uutbe pe nhi hai
Excellent video ! You are a great teacher
sir logn+1 kyu hoga<br>jb sbka record pointer store kr rahe hai
your videos really helps during exams great work :)
Thank you sir it is very helpful for me ☺️
oof, you have no idea how much i wish i could understand whatever Indian language this is -rip
<a href=""https://youtu.be/Ua08uVgsk4k?t=436"">https://youtu.be/Ua08uVgsk4k?t=436</a> is this complexity of search?
semester bacha lia sir aapne :)
This man is a different bread. It&#39;s my 5th year in DWH and never understood it properly. finally someone has explained it.I always prefer indian instructor in data sciences because their conceptual understanding is next level. Love from Pakistan. Thank you for you efforts! :)
is this English ?
Thank you so much sir for such an amazing lecture. Really helped a lot.
Good job 👌
For the key Secondary Index, I think N in logN+1 will be equal to No of entries in Index Table this will give us the block in which our key is present and +1 for searching in that particular block.<br>And According to you N=No. of block in Index table so this will give us a particular block and then we will search on this block then why we are doing +1 I think this can be done in also log time complexity bcz the key are sorted in order in index block. So overall Time complexity can be logN+logn.....Where N=No. of block in index table , n=No. of entries in Each block of Index table
great detail covered...I am completely relying on your channel for everything.
You explanation was so beautiful, almost philosophical! Love your explanations
i was banging my head on this topic for 3 hours and you made it so simple... you are simply awesome, plz never stop making videos :)
Very intuitive explanation, thanks sir. I read this concept in a blog but could not understand clearly. After watching this video , concept is crystal clear to me.
Is secondary index and non clustered index same?
Even I don&#39;t know Hindi well,I could understand your lecture..Your way of teaching is amazing 👌🏻. Thanks alot ,Sir 🤩
I was looking for a short video but these 40 mins were worth it, Thanks :)
Sir, I Have a query: In secondary unordered index, how it can be SPARSE?? Every entry in the index table has a pointer so isn&#39;t it dense?
explanation is good but too many ads...getting distract in between of understanding
But sir, what about the time complexity of creating the sorted index table and its space? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua08uVgsk4k&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a>
Excellent explanation.
Very clear content. Thanks for the awesome explanation !!
When I will be able to gather words to praise you, I will. Right now I am short of words.
Thankyou sir
Simply amazing .. thank you bro
No one is better than you man, Hats off to your explanation
sir g thank you very much <br>Agr ap na huty tu mera kya huta <br>and again thank you
I tried to learn this concept from many places but finally now  they <br>are clear Great Explanation sir.
I wish if you been in our clg as a teacher but no problem your videos help me a lot to understand the topic as well as to pass the semester.
Sir apke video bahut hi short hote he yehi mujhe bahut pasant he
But sir why can&#39;t we make secondary index sparse if it is sorted in the index table.
sir from where u got ur education???..such a huge amount of knowledge u have👏<br>thanks for sharing ur precious knowledge with us🙏☺

Such a great teacher!!.... Thank you so much!... Big fan from now. 🙌
Great👍👍👍
You saved my semester sir✌🏻
Thank you for making a complex topic simple.
at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua08uVgsk4k&amp;t=10m21s"">10:21</a> you have said that between intermediate layer and secondary index there will be a sparse index . But for every entry of secondary index, there is an intermediate record pointer i .e for A, there is a record pointer which points at all A &#39;s . So how it can be a sparse index? kindly explain.
thank you so much Sir ...Indeed very good explaination ... Would you please also explain what is inverted index . Index Locking concepts .. would be really greatful.
Thank you sir
Good Job<br>You have considered all the cases
Sir, are you studied FROM LPU
Bestest ever explination of indexing....all videos were awesome ....such an impeccable style of explination you have .
Could you please explain the time complexity without key more clearly?
Sir ye secondary index query run ke time banti hai ya pahle se hi ban jati hai <br>Agar 10 column hai to 9 secondary  key non key index bnege?<br>Fir to memory b bhut lgegi<br>Table ki replica bnani hogi secondary key ke sath
great content sir !"

How customer and order has strong realtion? If there is no customer then how come there exist an order table with order id?<br>Can we say then order entity depends upon customer entity and that they have a weak relation?
bohot hi badhiya
I&#39;m preparing for IT officer- Banking. These videos are tremendously helpful for understanding the concept from a really practical POV. Grateful to you Lakshay Bhaiyya and Love bhaiyya.

Thnx
Great lecture,thank you sir
No nice and easy to understand bcz of you
dhang se padhaao bhai topic se deviate na ho
One more example of Ternary relationship is : booking a movie in particular theatre by particular user :)
bhaiya one suggestion , when you start a topic please try to finish it there only. Like for example you started attributes and then there you didn&#39;t discussed the types there. then you started Relationship there also types were discussed later. Main problem in this is when i&#39;m making notes then starting one topic has to be finished there so that notes end up sequentially .  rest everything is fabulous .
Nyc video for making us confident.
lecture 4  done
in the example of Strong relationship, Customer and order is a weak relation because order will only exist when any customer places any order, isn&#39;t it?
at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMHJhhIx5k4&amp;t=37m00s"">37:00</a> are strong and weak entity defined correctly ? according to some sources ( cs dartmouth er modelling article) it is the opposite
Where to get notes?

But I have some doubt here, can you please explain that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUk8PgORTzo&amp;t=13m10s"">13:10</a> timestamp, that why name can&#39;t be breakdown like in the terms of (first-name,last_name) , we do in er model, please explain, else very helpful 💯
Day 3: Session 4
lecture are awesome but little sugesstion please also make dedicated playlist for computer networks like dbms
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUk8PgORTzo&amp;t=18m44s"">18:44</a> sec , sir you are saying that {cus_id , email} is the candidate key but {cus_id} is a super key and since candidate key is a minimum subset of super key so how can {cus_id , email}  be candidate key as cus_id it self is able to uniquely identify each tuple. .....plsss someone correct me if i am thinking wrong.
completed lecture 7
sir candidiate key can have null values
Candidate key can have null values!!
Candidate key can be null while primary key not be null.
how can super key have NULL ?? as the defination says that Super Key is P&amp;C of attributes which can uniquely identify tuple.   since name it  attribute itself alone is not included in super key . NULL should surely not be included in super key ig
Are aag🔥
thankyou bhaiya
here orders must be in total participation?
One Correction &quot;Candidate key can have null values but primary key can&#39;t&quot;
very smooth explanation ... besttttt👍
So well explained covered all points
is primary key must be unique like in above example as we can see that primary key is customer_ID can we take Contact Number as a primary key?
Sir you are amazing. Literally, I&#39;m getting the answer of all my doubts. And I don&#39;t think so it is just interview prospective. Your lectures explain thinks in deep and your way of teaching is mind blowing. I love the way you teach. Please keep teaching us sir. A heart for you sir❤.

can anyone tell <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUk8PgORTzo&amp;t=8m08s"">8:08</a> here, is orders making total participation with customer entity,  and is orders having weak relationship with customers?<br><br>i have little bit confusion in this concept of total participation and weak relationship
primary can be unique+ not null
thank you enjoying the course
BHUT HI BADHIYA
Well explained detailed explanation
candidate key is a key whose any proper subset is not super key
swad++
Candiate key ?
Enjoying this course. Keep up the good work. 🙏🏻
Very useful video!
this lecture is best and also the notes are very usefull thnks ....
Bhaiya you are exlaining great but there is a mistake in candidate key set. Only candidate key is customer_id as the other keys like(customer_id,email) are redundant .Also if {contact} is not a super key then it cannot be a candidate key. If super keys are {ABC},{AB},{A} ,then candidate key is {A}.Minimum subset of super key is candidate key.
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUk8PgORTzo&amp;t=45m00s"">45:00</a> if the foreign key can be made null Instead of deleting the entire tuple in child relation, won’t that create redundant data occupying useful memory in DB. What’s the use? Anyone?
Thank You Bhaiya
relation alzebra is not present yet
Dhanyadh Bhaiya🙏🙏
What is the difference between primary key and Unique key? Primary key can&#39;t be null, unique key can be null. We can have only one primary key but there can be many unique keys
The  lectures are just awesome and the notes are very very useful. Thanks a lot for this wonderful course

Sir, is it important to assign not null with primary key.
Dhanyawad bhaiya, learned so much and gained confidence
better soln for last question:<br><br>select a,b from table<br>union <br>select b,a from table
what if pair is (2,2) in last question 51
This is not enough . This is only 20 percent of what companies asking these days . Btw thanks for the lecture .
Q38 : select w.worker_id from worker AS w LEFT JOIN bonus as b where w.worker_id = b.worker_ref_id and B.bonus_amount IS NULL;  CAN WE  WRITE IN THIS MANNER?
Yes we can work on the sub querry{sub querrry{sub querry }};

WHERE IS THE  ATTACHED NOTES OF THESE QUERIES.
in the ques 34 there shouldn&#39;t be &#39;=&#39; sign there as it is showing the wrong output as geetika is the one who has highest 5th salary
It is understandable but in q-7 instead of first name department will come<br><br>select Ltrim(department ) from worker;
Helpful. Thanks!
Doubt Doubt, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIq9zkpGWc8&amp;t=15m35s"">15:35</a> me department descending nhi hi ascending hi, kyu??
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIq9zkpGWc8&amp;t=46m25s"">46:25</a> in question 36 ... To find third highest we will write <br>Select max(salary) from worker <br>Where salary not in (select max(salary) from worker where salary not in (select max(salary) from worker))<br>Is this correct??

Q3. using GROUP BY<br>```<br>SELECT department<br>FROM worker<br>GROUP BY department;<br>```
Q:42 -&gt;can we also write like this ?  SELECT * FROM WORKER WHERE WORKER_ID =(SELECT COUNT(WORKER_ID) FROM WORKER);
for the 42 question we can also dol <br>select * from worker <br>order by worker_id desc limit 1;

Q 39. DOES NOT WORK, Explanation -&gt; If a table consists of rows with worker_id(s) starting from 5 to 8 (4 rows are present in the table, assume somehow the first 4 records are deleted) now if we run the query mentioned in the video we will get an empty set of results because, count of the number of rows is 4 and that divided by 2 is 2. In the outer query we are comparing if the worker_id &lt;= 2 but here in our case it is none, however we want the rows with worker_id = 5, 6 (50% of 4 = 2, so rows with worker_ids = 5, 6).
we are using WHERE NOT EXISTS at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIq9zkpGWc8&amp;t=1h16m39s"">1:16:39</a> . does this mean we can also emulate MINUS operation as:<br><br>SELECT * from table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * from table2);
SELECT DEPARTMENT FROM WORKER GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
SELECT department FROM worker GROUP BY department; @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIq9zkpGWc8&amp;t=6m39s"">6:39</a>
query for determining 5th highest salary, i thing the 5th highest salary should be 90,000 as there two people with 500000  <br>i think we have to change it <br>where w2.salary &gt; w1.salary      ??
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIq9zkpGWc8&amp;t=20m19s"">20:19</a> select * from worker where first_name like &#39;%h&#39; AND LENGTH(first_name) =6;
MORAL YOU NEVER NEED TO REMEMBER SYNTAX YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW WE DO THAT AND CAN WE DO THAT
Q.36 We cannot increase the sub-queries in this manner to find the third highest and further highest numbers as it would all result into highest or second highest number only. We need to store both the values into a table and then find the number that is not inside that table. I did this using UNION function. My solution:<br>select max(salary) from worker<br>where salary not in (select max(salary) from worker<br>UNION<br>select max(salary) from worker<br>where salary not in (select max(salary) from worker));

In the 51st q the pairs which are not present  in reverse pairs will not come inside our not exists list but they should come right? So, why is it giving correct o/p?
to show all unique reversed pairs :<br>SELECT * FROM pairs AS p WHERE ((p.B,p.A) NOT IN (SELECT A,B FROM pairs)) OR ((p.B,p.A) IN (SELECT A,B FROM pairs) AND p.A&lt;p.B);
Q 36. To find the 3rd max salary, we cant find using &quot;not in&quot; i.e.<br>select max(salary) from worker<br>where salary not in (select max(salary) from worker<br>where salary not in  (select max(salary) from worker)); produces the highest salary<br><br>But if we replace &quot;not in&quot; with &quot;&lt;&quot; , it is working fine.

Very cute cat
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nweGaymEwGM&amp;t=56m30s"">56:30</a> . There is redundancy in the Professor table , Since, A non-prime attribute (Professor) can determine another non-prime attribute (Subject) as there is constraint ,&quot; Each professor will teach only single subject &quot; and only P-id is the Primary Key. Please Explain this or Correct me if I am wrong.

there is 2 other also 4NF and 5NF ??

Thank you
heloo how  at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nweGaymEwGM&amp;t=44m23s"">44:23</a>  how is it 2 NF because first table primary key is (student id and project id) but student name is fully dependent on student id ,, therefore partial dependecy
Explained so clearly with examples❤, just got better idea in dbms which i wasn&#39;t  when i learned it in clg1 year back
if a is subset of b does not imply that their intersection is zero A -&gt; ABC here ABC is not a Subset of A and intersection is non zero as well in what category will we put it trivial or non trivial
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nweGaymEwGM&amp;t=16m04s"">16:04</a>, Can we not do it like this?<br>CD-&gt;E, and E-&gt;A thus CD-&gt;A (using transitive property.)<br>Now,  we have BC-&gt;A thus BC-&gt;B (from 1st relation).<br>Then using reflexive property, as B is a subset of BC, we have a trivial functional dependency.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nweGaymEwGM&amp;t=16m00s"">16:00</a>  pe  B--&gt; C is possible
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nweGaymEwGM&amp;t=56m30s"">56:30</a>, but here in professor&#39;s table, professor(no-prime) attribute can determine subject(non-prime) attribute,  thus it&#39;s not following 3NF, right??
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nweGaymEwGM&amp;t=56m50s"">56:50</a>
maja aa gaya
ek hi example aata hai kya aap ko aur bhi example bhi diya karo samjh bhi tho aaya har baar ek hi example deta ho aap ishka ilawa koi aur sa nhi sikha hai kya...
id----department yeh toh trivial hoga na toh phir non trivial kiyu bolrahe hein kiyuki id seh department pata chal chaljayega
It was quite well explained

DBMS Placements Series 2022,PLDzeHZWIZsTpukecmA2p5rhHM14bl2dHU,Lecture 13: How to Implement Atomicity and Durability? || DBMS Interview question,CodeHelp - by Babbar,iNAaZNC7prE,1902.0,65158,1585,"
smjh aagya
CheckPoints : <br><br>    - The checkpoint is a type of mechanism where all the previous logs are removed from the system and permanently stored in the storage disk.<br><br>    - The checkpoint is like a bookmark. While the execution of the transaction, such checkpoints are marked, and the transaction is executed then using the steps of the transaction, the log files will be created.<br><br>    - When it reaches to the checkpoint, then the transaction will be updated into the database, and till that point, the entire log file will be removed from the file. Then the log file is updated with the new step of transaction till next checkpoint and so on.<br><br>    - The checkpoint is used to declare a point before which the DBMS was in the consistent state, and all transactions were committed.
Very Concise and deeper understanding of DBMS according to placements. Thanks Bhaiya
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNAaZNC7prE&amp;t=15m23s"">15:23</a> if logs are secure in stable storage, then we can also store db there right ? data will never get lost
amazing lecture series
bhaiya aap pahle kuch or batate or phir kuch or bata dete ho confusion bahut hota hai issse
CheckPoint Done
thousandth like!

How do we know the value 950 and 2050 in logs before calculations?
Can anyone tell what actually is difference between ram and disk when he says making changes at ram location and at disk location?
Day13 done ✓
swad++
great
Bhaiya checkpoint par video toh bana dete..
Sir, I have a doubt, You said that logs are written first and then operation performed. But what if commit log is written but before actual commit happens system crashes, then system restarts and sees the logs which is having commit, I think this can make problems....
👍thanks to you brother.
maine video puri dekhi

Best DBMS explanation ever
Very helpful vidoes ,Love you sir❤
what an amazing video!
amazing series going
Thanks for the amazing video on indexing.
bohot hi badhiya
GREAT EXPLANATION.
We cannot apply binary search directly in actual disk records because records are not necessarily stored in a contiguous manner in the disk, we use B tree (threaded M way tree) for this. It makes insertion and deletion faster as well.
Bhaiya your teaching skills are awesome. Thank you very much for this video.
Underrated video
Why we cannot use hashmap like data structure for indexing... For fast retrieval
Best explanation 💯
Best lecture!❤
@CodeHelp - By Babbar sir if  this message is received to you properly then kindly upload/ add a video on collation and its types in dbms
too good
17.04.2023
Great Lecture sir
God level content literally god level , genius guys next level next level ....
Unbelievable! This course deserves to be the best sql course ❤
Nice explanation 👍.
Indexing uses the concept of Hashing ? yes or not ?

schema kya hota hy
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl65apHxp64&amp;t=46m49s"">46:49</a>, would it be ok to say if you run a digital marketing company and want to build a user db, nosql would be good.
in vertical scaling i have to upgrade the RAM, CPU and Hardware which  increases our cost , so that we prefer horizontal scaling is better right.   so my first question is that what is the system here in vertical scaling and nodes in horizontal scaling..?
Thanks Bhaiya for the video
what an amazing video!
Your statement of retriving whole document in a query  for NOSQL is not true. We can select required attributes also.
great
it was great1
bhai kya hi pdha rhe ho lag rha hai koi jabardasti kar raha ho, thoda interest lekar aur interactive hokar pdhaya kro neend aa rhi h

mongodb is one of my favourite db
NOSQL as it is fast
Thank You Bhaioya
<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
nosql is my fav data base especially mongodb
Computer Networking -Placement series please 🙏🙏
NoSQL
network database for google maps, because we need graphs there
If my system is a banking company then I will go for the SQL database as it gives me the gurantee for the atomicity transaction, and acid properties, where in case of a crash the transactions can be rolled back. Even can go for MongoDb but as it is not used mainly in the financial company so will go for SQL but for web surfing company  where fast access of data is required I will go for the No SQL database
NoSQL
Wonderfull series Thankyouu Sir🥰
NOSQL is my  favorite DB. Because it is highly scalable and felxible.
NoSQL ❤
I personally feel noSQL is the quick and easy to learn database. Its community is also good and growing.
Could we use multiple database for huge application. like for some part of heirarchy are there and need for also huge storage and create link between them for application???   BTW awesome Videos i loved it !! <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>
nosql
thanku sir
Relational Databases yet slow in retrieving data but are robust and organized hence one of the best database model.
relational database model I will prefer to use
I like mongo DB the most because I think like while creating database I am creating a javascript objects
🤯🤯🤯
Nosql
if my software is like instagram then i would use NoSQL, if not then use Relational Databases
Awesome 👍
MySQL

mongo chicha is great

bohot badhiya
but wouldn&#39;t clustering affect the consistency of the database? how would server A know if a request changes some data in server B?

Great Lecture
👌🏻👌🏻
Bhaiya yeh doubt tha ki : Transactions kaise work krte hai clustering ke case me? mtlb kaise all the databases in different servers update hote hai, agar ek hi server ko load balancer layer transaction deta hai ?
Do we need multiple machines or multiple server within single machine?

bro, I think, scale-out(horizontal)  is more costly then scale-up(vertical). in this video you teach opposite. correct me if I am wrong.
Computer Networking -Placement series please 🙏🙏
bohot hi badhiya
A week ago i had my interview and due to which i had stop watching this playlist from this video . In second round of interview the question bcos of which i got rejected is - How you are going to deal when your website have large amount of data and how you are going the manage the requests of so many users.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now I am really confused a few videos ago you told us that horizontal scaling is used mostly with NoSQL databases because it&#39;s cumbersome to do it with rdbms because of joins and now you are saying that it&#39;s going to boost performance.<br>can someone please help me.
Can we get the notes of it??
Bhai itna slow course kabhi ni dekha. Ek hi chiz ko das bar bolra h. 2X m krne k bad b itna time consuming...only SQL videos were useful...baki to notes dekh k b smjh lete.
thanku sir
Great lecture sir
🐮🐮🐮🐮
bhaiya paise toh horizontal scale krne mai bhi lagenge suppose aapka main 10gb ka hai server storage ab apko replica banane ke lie bhi practically 10gb ke server kharidne ya rent out toh krne hae pdenge, toh cost effective to nhi hua horizontal scaling.
System design k aur course la do bhaiya to perfect preparation ho jaegi
whats the difference between server and database?
Which app do you use to write freehand text ?
Excellent information, but practical will help more. Waiting for some Basic practical sessions, thank you!
great
Maine video pura dekha
Thanks Lakshya Bhaiya. Love from MP(Ujjain)

bohot sahi padhaya bhaiya
What a mind blowing video 👑
bhai this is the best video ive ever seen replicating industry level designs
just wow
mazza agya sch mein 😀
Love the way you teach. You make each and every video very interesting.
bohot hi badhiya

Awesome DBMS lecture series 🔥🔥
amazing content!
HAPPY BHYA
Its interesting
Best video explanation sir 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
nice video
Great video
smj aa gaya
thanku sir
Please Make CN playlist similar to OS/DBMS <br>No good resources  are available for CN for Placement
In pattern 7: will all data centres have complete db or the part of data specific to that continent ?
Just enjoying a lot excellent series 💯
Great Explanation Sir
a generic question. Like you said vertical scaling will be expensive,and not industry useful, but looking at the replica method , i am pretty sure the replicas also will require good amount of expense to be scaled out or partitioned. So how does cost become a so big factor?
Keep it on aur lecture bnae advance level k
Does clustering in involves multiple machines or single machine with multiple server?
Thank you so much lakshya sr &amp;lots of love from the core of my heart❤
Day 19 Done ✓
Mast video &lt;3
I love your content! Your videos always brighten my day and bring a smile to my face.<br>Keep sharing your knowledge and inspiring others. <br>This is one of the best video in dbms placement series .🤘🏻❤
I am attending a paid System Design course. And I can definitely say that what Lakshay bhaiya taught in this particular lecture is of supreme quality and far better than what I learnt in this topic in the paid course. To eveyone reading this, if you&#39;re studying system design, this video is GOLD and Lakshay bhaiya is the DIAMOND who taught this very complex Distributed DB topic so elegantly.
Please don&#39;t stop making such industry level knowledge videos. Just loved them, waiting for more!
The quality of the content is very high thanks alot to both of you lakshya and babbar bhaiya.God bless you for providing free content.
i have finally reached here i feel very good
Thank you lakshya and love babbar bhaiya full quality video series ke liye
great
learned a lot brother, thanks to you.👍
Everything was fine as old wine
nice video
maine video pura dekha
Finally now i&#39;m in one of those who reached till the last 3 video of the playlist. Series starting videos has ~100k views but here only 5k views. this shows how many students left in between. I&#39;m officially in top 5% students now. 😜😜

Sir, what will happen in this scenario in context of 7th pattern: <br>When multiple write requests are given from different continents, then how will the replication happen between different data centres? <br>Won’t that cause a much higher latency due to replication of data among the data centres?
level 8 <br>kisi other planet per data management ke liye
Thank You soo much @lakshya bhaiyaa
Amazing Video... Best Explaination with examples.
Thank you bhai it&#39;s very helpful

By ChatGPT : <br><br>ACID Properties in DBMS ----------------------------------------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure the reliability and consistency of database transactions:<br><br>1. Atomicity: Transactions are treated as atomic units, which means they are either fully completed or fully aborted. There is no partial completion of a transaction.<br>2. Consistency: Transactions bring the database from one consistent state to another. The database should satisfy certain integrity constraints before and after the transaction.<br>3. Isolation: Transactions are executed in isolation from each other, ensuring that the outcome of one transaction does not affect the outcome of others.<br>4. Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and survive subsequent failures. The changes made by the transaction are stored in non-volatile memory.<br><br>These ACID properties are essential for maintaining the reliability and integrity of database transactions, particularly in systems where data consistency is critical.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) in NoSQL databases ------------------------------------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>In contrast, BASE is an acronym often used to describe the properties of some NoSQL databases, which prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency. BASE properties are considered more relaxed than ACID properties and are suitable for distributed and scalable systems:<br><br>1. Basically Available: The system remains operational and available for reads and writes, even in the presence of network partitions or failures.<br>2. Soft state: The system allows for temporary inconsistency between nodes, and the data state may be soft or in flux during updates.<br>3. Eventually Consistent: The system ensures that, given enough time, all replicas of the data will converge to a consistent state.<br><br>BASE properties are often associated with NoSQL databases like Cassandra, Couchbase, and DynamoDB, which are designed to handle large-scale, distributed, and dynamic data.
Very Good Explanation

Where is consistency in videos?
user khush ho jaega 2 lakh dikha raha hai??? 😁😁
bohot hi badhiya
Please make videos on NO SQL so that we  are able to work on this as well and any other leftover topic on SQL so that we are pro in DBMS in every angle
BASE  PROPERTY:<br>1) basically availability: if we apply eventually consistency then we want high availability and low latency.<br>2)]soft state: even if not given any input we  may experience that there is a change in data or updated<br>3)eventually consistency: if a user does an operation to write or read they may show that in the primary node they have updated if it may happens that due to  breakage or another issue, it is not updated in other replicas say R(3), and we not do any other operation further then after some time we may see that it gets updated  after some time<br>     this is another property for transactions.
bahut pyaara pdhaya h sir
which font you used in this notes.
&quot;BASE&quot; is an acronym that stands for Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventually consistent. It describes a set of properties often associated with NoSQL databases. Here&#39;s what each term means:<br><br>Basically Available: This means that the system remains operational and provides basic functionality even in the presence of failures or partitioning. In other words, the system is designed to be available for use, even if it means sacrificing consistency temporarily.<br><br>Soft state: NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and performance over strict consistency. Soft state refers to the idea that the state of the system may change over time, even without any input or activity. This characteristic allows for more flexible data models and eventual consistency.<br><br>Eventually consistent: NoSQL databases aim to achieve eventual consistency, meaning that after a certain period of time and in the absence of further updates, all replicas or nodes in the distributed system will converge to a consistent state. In other words, the system guarantees that the data will eventually become consistent, but there may be a temporary period of inconsistency.<br><br>These properties reflect a trade-off between consistency and availability, where NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency. It&#39;s important to note that not all NoSQL databases strictly adhere to the BASE properties, and the level of consistency and availability can vary depending on the specific implementation and configuration of the database.
Thanku sir
Great Lecture Sir
🤌🤌🤌
Thankyou thankyou thankyou so much ❤❤❤
BASE  PROPERTY:<br>1) basically availability: if we apply eventually consistency then we want high availability and low latency.<br>2)]soft state: even if not given any input we  may experience that there is a change in data or updated<br>3)eventually consistency: if a user does an operation to write or read they may show that in the primary node they have updated if it may happens that due to  breakage or another issue, it is not updated in other replicas say R(3), and we not do any other operation further then after some time we may see that it gets updated  after some time<br>     this is another property for transactions.
BASE MODEL:-<br>Basically Available :- This property are usually consisting of the Availability of data at all time to users by using AP (Available and Partition tolerant) model of database in this consistency is sacrificed for a period of time but eventually the system become consistent when nodes replicates.<br>Soft State :- This is the state of DB in inconsistent state usally the time between various nodes to replicate themselves.<br>Enventually consistent :- Database become consistent in this state.

Most of the time Gpay ya Paytm pe hamara balance load nahi hota but still ham payment kar pate hai this means at that time their replication is down right ?

Thank You for this Video
ACID Model:<br>Collections of operations that form a single logical unit of work are called transactions and the database system must ensure proper execution of transactions and the ACID database transaction model ensures that a performed transaction is always consistent. To explain ACID in more detail and easy way is to understand through breaking down the acronym, ACID:<br><br>Atomicity: This property states transaction must be treated as an atomic unit, that is, either all of its operations are executed or none, and there must be no state in a database where a transaction is left partially completed also the states should be defined either before the execution of the transaction or after the execution of the transaction.<br>Consistency: The database must remain in a consistent state after any transaction also no transaction should have any adverse effect on the data residing in the database and if the database was in a consistent state before the execution of a transaction then it must remain consistent after the execution of the transaction as well.<br>Isolation: In a database system where more than one transaction is being executed simultaneously and in parallel, the property of isolation states that each one of the transactions is going to be administered and executed as it is the only transaction in the system also no transaction will affect the existence of any other transactions.<br>Durability: The database should be durable enough to hold all its latest updates even if the system fails or restarts so, In a practical way of saying that if a transaction updates a chunk of data in a database and commit is performed then the database will hold the modified data but if the commit is not performed then no data is modified and it can only be done when the system start.<br>The databases that are ACID compliant are the one safe way to make sure your database is ACID compliant is to choose a relational database management system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. Some NoSQL DBMSs, such as Apache’s Couch DB or IBM’s Db2, also possess a certain degree of ACID compliance(There are no recommendations of No SQL database if the requirement is of strict ACID rules).<br><br>Base Model:<br>The rise in popularity of NoSQL databases provided a flexible and fluidity with ease to manipulate data and as a result, a new database model was designed, reflecting these properties. The acronym BASE is slightly more confusing than ACID but however, the words behind it suggest ways in which the BASE model is different and acronym BASE stands for:-<br><br>Basically Available: Instead of making it compulsory for immediate consistency, BASE-modelled NoSQL databases will ensure the availability of data by spreading and replicating it across the nodes of the database cluster.<br>Soft State: Due to the lack of immediate consistency, the data values may change over time. The BASE model breaks off with the concept of a database that obligates its own consistency, delegating that responsibility to developers.<br>Eventually Consistent: The fact that BASE does not obligates immediate consistency but it does not mean that it never achieves it. However, until it does, the data reads are still possible (even though they might not reflect reality).

Nice explanation
sir if we  compare OLAP with OLTP. <br>then which is better?
I cannot understand whether it is English or another language?
in this video he predicted that in 5 to 10 years we will have the computer programs which would determine the probability of stock markets and here we are... we have low level of prediction softwares in 5 years and may be in 10 years we are going to have better softwares
Excellent explanation just loved the way he taught.

Shouldn&#39;t mobile number be an attribute? in previous videos, mobile number was considered as an attribute (multi-attribute).
i see english words in the whiteboard, but listen tonguetwister... have any dubbed or subbed video?
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUokY6sA3UE&amp;t=14m10s"">14:10</a> m:n should be in the middle and 1:1 should be on the outer rectangle
Sir, great lecture as always but u have used Aadhar Number as an entity in your example that doesnt seem right to me. Aadhar Number can be an attribute of an indian citizen and not an entity
Such a wonderful explanation ❤️<br>Love from Pakistan 🔥❤️🔥
great
GREAT
I have seen the best explanation of this topic .................. thank you sir
sir shayad apne <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUokY6sA3UE&amp;t=14m26s"">14:26</a> par galti se galat samja diya gaya kya ??<br>kyuki m:m also 1:1 but vice versa is not possible take your adahar card exmple vo to galat hoga na plz sir explain<br>aur agar ap rid karte ho to comment pin kar dena taki dusaro ko confusion na ho isi liye

Thank you sir for better understanding 🤗
Example of Many to One - Religion (Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian) ----------- &lt;are&gt; -----------&gt; INDIAN
Best teacher in the world
thank you sir
Recursive and none or zero is also part of the type of relationship of cardinality
&#39;&lt;a href = &quot;something&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;&#39;
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;something&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
&lt;a href = &quot;something&quot; &gt;something&lt;/a&gt;
Best lecture sir
Thanks sir g
What a teacher
Sir your lecture is somehow missing something...like without explaining what is cardinality you started teaching cardinality mapping...you taught foreign key without explaining
Sir mapping constraints nd mapping cardinalitiea same hain ?
What&#39;s the example for N:1(many to one).
Are these videos sufficient for preparation of gate ?
J2EE k lectures plzzz
Every topic you cover gets crystal clear. hats off Sir 🙌🙏❤️
Adhar number duplicate banayga toh jail pakka jana tai hai
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUokY6sA3UE&amp;t=14m12s"">14:12</a>  since there are going to be multiple select questions in 2021,  will  we have to select all the 4 options ( 1:1 ,  1:n , n:1 , n:m ), if the answer is  (1:1) ???   can anyone expalin this...........
What will be the cardinality for follower following system like in twitter? If I have 2 separate table for users and followers?
Every MANY to MANY can be ONE TO ONE but ONE to ONE can&#39;t be MANY to MANY<br><br>I think he said the opposite...
Is this DBMS playlist cover all topics of GATE??
many to one ka example nhi diya sir
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUokY6sA3UE&amp;t=6m05s"">6:05</a> best action....
Good &#39;ol days when Aadhar determined citizenship of an Indian 😂😣

sirji kanhaiya ki tarah bolte hain na
thank you very much ! .
strong and weak relationships?
sir 1 to 1 jo he wo many to many nahi ho skta<br>sirf many to many 1 to 1 ho skta he
Sir DBMS ka practical tutorials bhi banaiye na.
Sir every many to many relation is also called as one to one, or sir correct me if i am wrong.
yeh kya blaa hai,  lol
Thank you so much sir for giving ur time to us by these awesome lectures <br>U r a very good teacher ❤️<br>May ur subscribers rise and rise more
chaliye shuru karte he
I wish that this would be in English 😔
thank you sir🙏
where is many to one example????
Some have 1:M, some have 1:N what is correct?
Can anyone tell me... How every one to one relation is many to one or one to many??
wow sir, really concepts clear kr dete  hain ap Puri tarah .... tq
Jidhar n hota h....udhar arrow lgegaa naa sir?
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUokY6sA3UE&amp;t=11m30s"">11:30</a> it is said that every one to one is one to many or many to one ...... how can that be?? It can be agreed that every one to many or many to one is one to one!
Sir apne bola ki koi relationship 1 to 1 hai to wo many to many ho sakta hai... Par wo to aadhar card ki example me work nahi karta???
those 15 students who will never understand DBMS in life....sed life :(
Why is there no video on ER diag practice questions
Thnku so much sir 🙏🙏
Bhut ache sir ji
Sir  I am cs 1st year student and saw your lecture so how I have to prepare or make notes or how to make notes and similar query please make a vedio how I have  study to crack gate

Exelant
आपका मतलब है  वन टू वन relationship ko many to many bhi kaha ja sakta hai?

I m preparing for my exams<br>.. and KG rocks🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1 to 1 as in first example can not be one to many
sir please continue the er diagram lectures please
Hatsoff to you sir! You are an amazing teacher. You reduce all these big scary topics to just basics which only need some practice before main exams like GATE, NET and these are always helpful in <a href=""http://b.tech/"">B.Tech</a> and many other fields.

very nice lecture but in this lecture you did not explain the word constrain in hindi or simple english  &quot;Rules&quot;
11 lectures dekhne ke baad , pata chala incomplete hain ;🥲
Sir I&#39;m following your videos for my exam preparation  .<br>Thanks for providing enough content ❤❤.<br>But , some videos are missing ,  sir Focus on it.
Yes sir there is no video for strong and weak entity
Sir in the ending You said that we will talk about weak and strong entity set .... But there are no such video in the playlist.  Please make videos on that.
If minimum cardinality of project is 3 then according to definition of minimum cardinality, at least 3 entities of project must participate in a project-employee relation. It means each employee must have atleast 3 projects. This exolanation is based on the definition. But the explanation you have given in this lecture can only be justified if cardinalities of project are (0,2) and cardinalities of employee are (3,15)<br>Please make this correction or tell me if i am wrong
Sir aapne traps topic skip kr diya ER mein
Thank you sir🙏🙏
thank you sir. you are the best. i have my exam tomorrow. you saved my life. may god bless you.

I 😍 this course and liked all of your videos, but disliked this video because you have not uploaded the next part of the 📼 video. Please don&#39;t do this. At least complete this topic. <br>I had bought Ravindra Babu Sir&#39;s lecture but followed yours considering that you have uploaded all the topics, but after watching 20 videos , I saw that you have not completed the course.<br>Sir please don&#39;t do this. It was the most frustrating thing happened with me.<br>I wasted my precious time by following your tutorials.<br>Atleast read the comments  in the videos. Everyone is telling you to complete the topic but you are not doing.<br>I think It was my mistake, I followed your tutorial.I have wasted my time by watching Your tutorials. Will never recommend it to anyone 😡.<br>Friendly bump 👊 🤜
Sir , make a vedio on weak entity<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Weak"">#Weak</a> Entity Types
Please sir ER to RELATIONAL conversation complete kara dijiye sir

Very well..
Thanks sir g
thankyou so much sir for providing us such quality content for free.
Sir your teaching style is awesome   in automata because this is your original style but in these lectures mixing of language got trouble to me . Please sir teach in only hindi languge
Are jab thumbnail pr hindi likha hai to hindi mein hi banani chahiye thi na English bole jare ho isme bhi 🤬
Sir please release ur courses on oops, web technology, data structure and others full course bcoz i have no money to pay for unacademy and i want ur courses bco u teach in abest way please sir
Aapne Hindi ke tutorial me english May kayu lacture diye?
sir please upload in english
ABDE----&gt;C<br>is ABDE depends on C , if the values would have different in C then it would be correct as well as per my understanding because ABDE did not repeat anywhere, if this could have repeated then the dependency holds good in that case too. It was a question &amp; I got the answer as well :)
ThankYou Sir.. Your concepts helped me in this situation...where we are getting online learning

Thank you sir for such beautiful explanation.<br>Kya ab bhi in videos me Sara syllabus cover nai ho paya he gate ki preparation ke liye ?<br>I am preparing for GATE by watching your videos for DBMS .
sir plz teach us computer graphics also, we don&#39;t get decent tutorials of it specially for university exams.
In case of DE-&gt;C <br>we are not getting the different value of alpha to beta.<br><br>like <br>for.      4,5 we are getting 3<br>again   4,5 we are getting 3<br>again   6,5 we are getting 3<br>             6,6 we are getting  3<br><br>we should have got different value of 5,5 and 6,5 right na ?<br><br>bt we are getting again 3 for the both . As we have already got 3 as a value of beta to aplha .
Same happened with me <a href=""http://now.how/"">now.How</a> that duster sticking on the board.This is the first time I&#39;m seeing such magnetic duster.I&#39;ll tell my college chancellor to bring or implement such duster in the college though it is lesser use in my college.

Thanks sir g
Our country has high budget teachers with low experience while this teacher is sharing way far knowledge than a paid teacher. That&#39;s why India has most experience student and teachers.
I hope that you see this comment🙏<br>I was so confused about this topic , and I could&#39;ve never imagined that i can solve these questions let alone do it in few seconds. But after watching your videos and solving example with you, I paused the video and noted down the question and tried solving on my own by applying your tricks, and sir, you won&#39;t believe me(neither did i at first) I solved the question within 8-10 seconds, REALLY! Although, i was sure of my answer, but i played the video to verify it for my satisfaction and it was indeed right! I was shocked!! I know this might sound so exaggerated, but for a person like me who always had no confidence in &#39;solving mcqs in seconds&#39; was like a miracle! Thank you so much sir :)🙏
Thanks sir sari confusion door ho gyi

In transitive rule a to b and b to c then a to bc is hold not a to c sir because we get two different values on the same value of a?

Sir I respect u &amp; ur style of explaining...but COMPOSITION can also be proved more easily by the AUGMENTATION AXIOM by adding Z to 1st statement &amp; Y to 2nd statement!!!
Ty☺
wao.kmaal k sr app smjatay h.amazong.your lecture is so much nice as you are good looking<br>from pakistan
Hey won&#39;t we have a C+ as a primary key cause all attributes are dependent on C
Thanks sir
Sir is functional dependency from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, implies that we can find every value of B from A,  and is it mandatory that every value of A cantains a corresponding value or result in B? <br>please help me sir.

Why are we lacking teachers like you in our college.....
Sir in composition we can also do augmentation by adding z in first and adding y in second. Hope I&#39;m correct!!
Dear sir,<br>In the reflexivity condition, you said that &#39;y&#39; is a subset of &#39;x&#39; but according to the conditions &#39;y&#39; is the proper set of &#39;x&#39;. Kindly clarify.

Sir,it&#39;s amazing can I get some more questions on closure for practice 👍
My new earphone got  damaged after this lecture!
thank you sir
Great video 🔥
Thanks sir g
If ABH determines BD , does thqt implies AH determines BD?
In the first question R(ABCDEFG) by using augmentation rule we can get AC^+ = ABCDEG
thank you  sir.<br>and for those who are listening with one ear &quot;just turn on mono audio in your device&quot;.
For those crying over left ear, enable mono sound in your sound settings and you are good to go
Sound 😬😬😬😬

Sir what i have only word is for u that you are a super key for for many attributes(for students)
can you please group out video? It is difficult to find next video of same topic.
It&#39;s painful if you don&#39;t understand a topic because of voice quality.

nope , your earphones are just fine.
What if closure of whole table is given??suppose f=(abc)...find f+....?

Literally a life saver. The most subtle explanation there is… 👌

If we find the closure set of (AE) on both F and G  then answer comes the same and it also takes less time

sir in each video title you write &quot;In Hindi&quot; but in whole video you mostly speak in English so please don&#39;t fool students
What is equivalence🤔
Sir in this question the functional dependency of E is not possible as we are able to search AD as well as H from E,  So sir is it correct or not??
He said consentrate for 2 minute, but the video left was 1 minute😂
Sir whenever u free,make video on ur journey from student to teacher..we are excited to see ur story..
very good explanation sir n very good example👌👍👍👏👏👏👏
it be a,b,c all the 3 options ?
Is left side closure f&lt;=g or g&lt;=f?
SLOW DOWN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
sir please upload videos in english , So it will helpful to all students
this man from English to Hindu real quick.. holy shit still good tho...now im learning two things at once.. hindu and comp sci

Happy teachers day and sir you are a very good teacher your lecture help us very much
Very well explained videos. Keep up the good work.
i have problem sir ...you told that for every a-&gt;b is functional dependency if every value of a is same then the value of b is also same otherwise it is not functional dependency .........in above example you said E-&gt;AD and E-&gt;H .......is functional dependency ????
Thanks sir
Great and very genuine videos, had a glimpse of learning these in college days during year 2002 but never able to grasp so thoroughly, now it seems like a piece of cake all because of you. I was just refreshing all what I learnt in college now that all these are not useful to me but still find them interesting :). So thank you for making it interesting and we need human beings like you to shape our future 😊….Kudos sir ji 😊<br><br>In this particular video, can we do in simple way like mentioned below: Instead of doing cross power evaluation, we can simply run all dependencies, like for example:<br><br>R(ABCDEFGH)<br><br>N:                      iteration 1                        iteration 2               iteration 3<br>A-&gt;G   =                 AG                                                                <br>AB-&gt;C     =                                                                                  AGHBC <br>C-&gt;FG   =                                                                                    AGHBCFG (Final)<br>H-&gt;B    =                                                      AGHB<br>G-&gt;H   =               AGH<br>(Now these are all possibilities) =&gt; AGHBCFG  = ABCFGH (removing duplicates)<br><br>R(ABCDEFGH)<br><br>M:                 i1                 i2<br>A-&gt;EFG  = AEFG <br>C-&gt;DBH =                   AEFGCDBH     <br>B-&gt;DE =                      AEFGCBDEH (FInal)<br>G-&gt;C =   AEFGC<br><br>(Now these are all possibilities) =&gt;AEFGCBDEH  = ABCDEFGH (removing duplicates)<br><br>That means N is subset of M.
I am visiting your channel first time and totally loving the way you are explaining. Simple and easy to learn examples. Thank you so much you are doing a great job. (Y).<br><br><br>I have also subscribed to other paid content providers however I find them quite boring and I feel sleepy after 1-2 videos. But today I started at 8 PM and it is 4:30 AM in the morning and your videos are still very interesting.
Clean explanation.. 💜
Thanku so much sir....now it&#39;s clear to me
I think it would be better if you write F&lt;Equivalent&gt;G rather than F=G. That is you should equivalent sign rather than equals sign because F equals to G and F equivalent G both are different. <br>Please correct me if I am wrong.
Thank you sir....
sir please upload videous on inference rules and give more videous with examples
I wish you taught me DBMS at my university!
Dhanyavad sir for your hard work to teach us😆
F side E ka do value hai, then how it is function is defined
Sir how com F has 2 values for E. Then it does not fit for functional dependency.
Nice
Excellent👍👍👍👍
ure a GOD SIR . MY GOD OF DBMS
Awesome explanation sir !! :)
thank you for your  effort sir. you are doing very good and your way of explanation is awesome it   fits into mind very easily
In your 1st lecture you said that  for every value &#39;a&#39; we  get unique &#39;b&#39; but here in your example of functional dependency F<br>,there are 2 values of E for which we are  getting two different values AD and H.
jo yeh comment pad raha hai ,sahi hai top maaroge :)
Thank you so much sir. Your explanation is crystal clear. I am subscribing to your channel
really helpful sir
best video on the topic
Sir for dependency we must have same value of bita for same alpha but in example for E we have different values ...HOW?
Very very good lecture sir ..
Dutch student here :). Even though I don&#39;t understand the (I suppose) Indian language between the English, your videos are still so helpful for me! Thank you so much sir
thank you sir..✌️✌️
Thanks for this wonderful understanding..
Sir E in left side is same and other side is different ....how can this be correct?
Just amazing!!!!👏👏👏Great skills.
sir can E have two values which is defined in the function F?
sir...now u r my best teacher
greatest among all
thnks sir.....
Of course Sir You r doing good Job I m really impressed with your job nice videos
Racer wala example sun kae mazaa aa gaya  😂
Is it functionally dependent given that<br>E----&gt;AD<br>E----&gt;H<br>As in earlier lectures(A-----&gt;B) you said value determined by A should be same.
one word  i say ...super...sir your all videos like TOC,DBMS..all videos in these subjects great.....so thank you so so much sir
bhagwaan aapka bhala kare &lt;3
sir u had said that when beta is dependent on alpha then for same value of alpha it shouldalways give the same value of beta isnt that true???<br> then how does e=ad and e=h valid as functional dependency
Sir great work....but what&#39;s the concept of FcoversG and GcoversF ?
awesome !!!
sir i  was facing more difficulty in FD now my concept is clear so for that thank you so much sir...........
Sir in F functional dependency, E is giving the values for AD and H. According to your first lecture there should be only one value to E.
Realy superb
sir here for same value of E there are two different value ie; AD and H...how is this possible???is it hols functional dependency?????????????

really good videos, I must say that our college teacher must go through it and tech us in the same way. thank you
I really like your work....it&#39;s need lot of hard work for creating such awsome stuff
great sir, thanks a lot for uploading vedios.
Your use of Hindu in between does make it easier to understand the concepts.  The people who have issue with this should just go find some other video -_-<br>And thank you so much.  These videos really helped to a lot :)
um... why didnt you just make two videos. One in each language? I had trouble puzzling out what was being said
Best lectures! It is very easy to understand all concepts, due to the way of your teaching :)<br>Thank you!
sir, <br>here E implies AD &amp; E implies H... <br>is it correct?

Sir, I had a question, if I am trying to find equivalence doesn&#39;t it make more sense if for two sets of functional dependencies F and G, we first find the closure of all the left hand side values of F using F and then do the same using G and then compare both of them to see which is a subset of which one. The same should be done while dealing with G. Could you plz correct if I am wrong.

Actually in present and next video sir has taken different steps, in this video: while checking if there&#39;s any redundancy on LHS at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0GQQFu-5C0&amp;t=11m35s"">11:35</a>, sir has ignored one functional dependency which was &quot;wz=&gt;y&quot;... But in the next video in the same method(video name 3.9 practise questions..), at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0GQQFu-5C0&amp;t=19m45s"">19:45</a>, sir has not ignored &quot;vw=&gt;x&quot;.<br>And if we do not ignore &quot;vw=&gt;x&quot;, we get a different result..<br>What is the correct way!!!
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0GQQFu-5C0&amp;t=12m00s"">12:00</a>
sir ma bohot dino se GATE SMASHER channel se padh ra tha unki concept pura ( geek for geek) site se liya gaya ha  jo ke dimag me easily nahi ghuss raha tha<br>BUT<br>FIR APP KA CHANNEL MILA---bass fir jo chizz  samajhne me 2 din lag ra tha wo app ke ek video dekhne me he ho ga ra ha
6 years ago these videos were uploaded and they are very relevant and fresh till date!!! great job sir, you really are a saviour!
Aacha huya sir g aap koi universities mein na jakar <br>Kiuki hum logoko koi ek best understanding guide mil gaya hai clg  mein ghanto ka lecture sunne k bhi utna samaj nahi aata hai wajah aapka 1 explanation vdo kafi hai<br><br>Aap jaise teacher aur bhi jarurat hai society mein<br>👍 🙏

Not able to understand
(WZ)+ = WZXY  ....(W)+ and (Z)+....wala concept galat h sir aapka....in this we ll check only whether W+ will contain Z or not, not the whole WXYZ and if W+ contain Z that means Z is extraneous attribute or simple Z is redundant....................Kindly pin your comment and tell this mistake of your video to all viewers
Thanks sir g
Great explanation ...great🙏
very good teaching sir.
Best explanation ever! Thank you
Consider a given relation R=(P,Q,R,S) with following set of <br>FDs: PQ→R<br>PS→Q<br>QS→P<br>PR→Q <br>S→R <br>Find the minimal set of FDs from the above set. Please help
Sir, hume kya order mein hii hide karna hai kya....
What do you understand by the term <br>closure of a relation (R) with functional <br>dependency set (F) ?

Sir,<br>While removing left redundancy, what if wz+, w+, and z+ are same,<br>Like will we remove the Dependency, or take anyone of w and z
If u r writing hindi in title then it should be in hindi completely
Sir, your videos are more better understandable then our professors.....Thank you sir for making the lectures on youtube.
Thank u sir <br>Love u sir<br>For playlist
Very nice
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0GQQFu-5C0&amp;t=2m32s"">2:32</a> In functional dependency , if y --&gt; x and y --&gt; z then x=z right? How can we decompose it like that? suppose if we have y --&gt; 345 and  y --&gt; 346 is valid. But decomposing them will create violations in functional dependency right?
Revision krrha hu m.... Sir u r just amazing
I have a doubt.<br>When I am checking &quot;&quot;is Z redundant in WZ-&gt;Y ?&quot;&quot; then why we are hiding &quot;WZ-&gt;Y&quot; completely.<br>Rather what we should do, is to HIDE ONLY Z i.e. keeping &quot;W-&gt;Y&quot;<br><br>Because if Z is redundant in WZ-&gt;Y , then resulting FD will be W-&gt;Y.
Sir mjy kuch question solve karwany how can I contact you??
Sir kindly tables say FD&#39;s niklna sekha dayn
Sir I used ur concept in my end term paper and I lost 5marks coz ur technique is wrong, over the internet they r using some other method and none of them mentioned ur method, using their method we get different ans(which is considered correct) and by using ur method the and is not correct.
Maaf kre ki saaf kre😂😂👌 op sir
Great videos but too many ads
It&#39;s kind of ridiculous when a video half in Hindi makes more sense than anything that was explained in class in English. You make it so simple.

Sir can we write minimal functional dependecy as  A-&gt;B,C-&gt;B,D-&gt;BC,AC-&gt;D to AC-&gt;DBC,C-&gt;B,D-&gt;BC
if f.d. ={A-&gt;B,C-&gt;B.D-&gt;ABC,AC-&gt;D} THEN WHAT SHOULD minimal fd for this ? i have some confuse in this as according to me my answer is  A-&gt;B,C-&gt;B,D-&gt;BC,AC-&gt;D .IS IT RIGHT
Thanks sir but also upload computer network series please thanks again

Best! Thank you so much , sir!
sir please make video for dfd diagram

wish if we could have these videos in our student life or in our 30&#39;s  .
LHS me kya krna hai smjh me nhi aya hai sir redundancy kaise hategi usme confusion horhi hai
Thanks sir aap bhot achcha pdate ho
A-&gt;BC , B-&gt;AC ,C-&gt;AB  will not work by this method . or we need to find specific sequence to implement this method . correct me if i am wrong.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-F6QfdheEk&amp;t=2m51s"">2:51</a> X ke hone na hone se kuch fark nahi pda, X extra hi thi. Hence proved XD
Apse acha koi ni
Thanks sir g
Minimal set of fd is affected by an order in which you are checking redundancy
sir last q me aapne v closure nikala h at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-F6QfdheEk&amp;t=19m52s"">19:52</a> usme x ni ayega therefore both v and x are essential
Plz help me getting the minimal functional dependency F = {A -&gt; BCE, AB -&gt; DE, BI -&gt; J}.
Thanks lot sir, This helped a lot in exam
Sir, if we cannot decompose lhs. Then why are we computing the closure of lhs and eliminating it? Indirectly we are decomposing itself right?
No one can teach like you sir...you teach in a very easy way...its great
In the second numerical you have told wrong while finding the redundancy in VW-&gt;X. When you were finding the closure of V u considered the Functional dependency VW-&gt;X so the answer is wrong. The correct answer is V-&gt;W, VW-&gt;X and Y-&gt;VZ.
sir please explain in english
wrong in second step...it should be y+-&gt;yxvwz
If to remove the redundancy on the LHS with five terms ABCDE-&gt;X,do we need to have 2^5-1 iteration
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-F6QfdheEk&amp;t=18m13s"">18:13</a> sir you are doing wrong.
In closure of VW=VWX , what will be the the outcome if V=VWX AND W=VWX?
very useful videos
Hi can you please explain R(ABCDEFG) A--&gt; B , ABCD--&gt;EG,ACDF--&gt;E ?
Thank u sir<br>Love u sir<br>For playlist
sir in last question redundancy is due to &#39;v&#39; not &#39;w&#39;.... please checkk
In the first example we get D-AC &amp; AC-D , so by using transitivity can we write D-D, If we can write that does D-D signifies anything or it is just said to be trivial functional dependency?
Sir can we combine ac to bd ?
for the last step i.e. left reduction it is better to follow the method by this guy <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS-LJMTVVj8&amp;list=PLxCzCOWd7aiFAN6I8CuViBuCdJgiOkT2Y&amp;index=27"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS-LJMTVVj8&amp;list=PLxCzCOWd7aiFAN6I8CuViBuCdJgiOkT2Y&amp;index=27</a>
Y+ is written wrong sir
While finding redundancy in left-hand side do we need to ignore or not....I mean, while checking for redundancy in (VW)---&gt;X while finding V+ and W+ should we ignore (VW)---&gt;X or not
Too good sir...👌👌👍👍
Thank you sir
Sir you are not less than Saint whose selfless efforts is for us

sir, devta ho aap 🙏🙏

Thankkuu so much sir maza a gaya jis tarika s aap hame padhate ho and practice krba t ho 👏👏🖒
Great sir thank you so much
Thanks sir but also upload software engineering artificial intelligence as UGC net point of view thanks again sir
I think correct answer should be: V-&gt;W, W-&gt;X (because we removed V as it was redundant), Y-&gt;VZ
What is minimal set of functional dependencies
so at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-F6QfdheEk&amp;t=14m32s"">14:32</a> ? AC--&gt; D, and D --&gt; AC, Can we not make one of them redundant? as they are basically the same dependencies but flipped the other way ?
The answer of the last discussed question will be  v-&gt;wx and y-&gt;v ....
in last lecture u said while calculating u ignore the term,here in 2nd question u didnt do tht...due to which v+=vwx,if u ignore the relation u wiill get v+=vw...making it non reduntant...
Sir either Complete us leave us....
Guys!at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-F6QfdheEk&amp;t=13m00s"">13:00</a> sir  clearly mentioned that in AC-&gt;D if closure of AC and A is same then C becomes redundant.<br>And also if we solve taking W-&gt;X it then holds transitivity with V-&gt;W , making the actual result V-&gt;X.<br>Which directly comes by eliminating W rather than V.
Canonical cover for A-C,AC-D,E-AD,E-H
Arey btado doubt Bhai Kal exam hai Mera ..lode lag jayenge yrr 😪
Atleast try to reply your viewers .<br>You made a point in last step of second question which contradicts what you said in previous video
your method would not work for finding minimal cover set of the following f.d.s {B -&gt; A , D -&gt; A, AB -&gt; D}.
Did he speak English?
Bot sala
You&#39;re a savior!
namaskaar donston mein hun sanchittt.........My favourite lineeeeee
your teaching method and example clicks very well but my college professors not.....
Sir, Can we apply other inference rules in the last step other than union rule if applicable?
Thanks sir ...you are great
C to b will also be redundant na cozzz we could derive d to b at that time
Sir apne previous video me kaha tha ki closure same nikle par first wali f.d ko remove krte h... Or es video me apne bad wali f.d ko remove kia... Confusion... Please make me correct
Mistake at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-F6QfdheEk&amp;t=18m01s"">18:01</a> pls check and correct
Thanks very much sir😆
your videos helped me a lot sir 😊😊
sir ur videos are really awesome . can u plz make lectures on relational algebra.
sir there is a problem at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-F6QfdheEk&amp;t=18m07s"">18:07</a> y⁺=vxzw not y⁺=yvxzx and yₓ⁺=yvzwx <br>and by this what is the correct answer
There is problem sir, y+=yvxzw is right, Not y+=yvxzx
while checking rhs in second ques while checking v closure you have also checked with vw-&gt;x but in previous video of canonical cover you said to ignore that fd in which we are checking....it&#39;s creating confusion
Sir how to find out the number of different minimal cover possible..plz make a video related to this...
plzz upload B+ tree and locking protocols
in the last step of the 2nd question v closure is same as vx closure and w ka closure is different . Then  v should be redundant as it is same and should not be part of solution . Can u please clarify this ??. Thanks
b and b+ trees sir
@Knowledge gate:. Sir, Did you upload videos for relational algebra?
Please upload video on this topic Lossless Join and Dependency Preserving Decomposition

Doing  data science in Italy  , I have exams DBMS and all I listening to your lectures .

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvAcuNvvNk&amp;t=14m40s"">14:40</a> , Sir why ACD will be a candidate key, as it&#39;s subset that is (B)+ is a candidate key in itself and super key as well.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Bahut acchese samaja aya sir <br>Thank you sir !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Your teaching skill is great sir g❤️love from Nepal.
If there whould be excellence award of teaching you would definitely get that one
Opppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
Sir ki jitni tareef ki jaye kam hai …..bahot asani se sab samjha dia…. ✌️👍 thank you so much
ACD is a candidate key but if it gets compared with B then there is no chance of a subset right??
Sir, your explanation skills are excellent
best teaching sir
sir words are not enough to describe your excellency.
The Besttttt!!!!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
💯💯👍👍👍
Great work
Damnnnn...Sir Thanks for clearing our doubts..❤️❤️
Thank You Sir 🙏🙏
Superb video sir ji
Sir while you decomposing  , &quot; ACD&quot; , then it would be &quot;A&quot; , &quot;C&quot; &amp; &quot; D&quot; , not  &quot;A&quot; , &quot;B&quot;  &amp; &quot;D&quot;
great video
Best Explaination
excellent

At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvAcuNvvNk&amp;t=14m04s"">14:04</a> note that B is not a proper subset of ACD.  D should be written in place of it.
We need this lucture in English-speaking
Thanks sanchit sir 🙏🙏<br>For ur Nice and Easy way of explaination <br>I&#39;m literally finding this in YouTube and finally get it ur best playlist of dbms 🙏🙏
Excellent
very good explaination
Excellent superb explanation by Sir Sancit Jain. I salute you Sir. MAY ALLAH bless you.
sir ji shayri ho gyi yeah to use super key ko candidate key kehte hai us super key ko candidate key kehte hai jo uska proper subset nahe ho.
Sir I must say that there&#39;s no better explaination and simplification in the world than this lecture. Wish you alot of blessings sir
what an explanation SIR , GREAT
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvAcuNvvNk&amp;t=16m56s"">16:56</a> was funny😂
How can I calculate no of superkeys if candidatekey are given

thanks a lot sir
Simple and good
Awesome content must watch if u want to understand this topic ❤️

vada pura hua
Sir aap ne ek place par galti kar diya,,, primary key,, woh hota hai jo candidate key+no null value bhi ho,,,, student please correct this point <br>Thanks sir
Watching this again after 2 years 🤩... Remembering those college xams and ur videos
Jahapana tussi grt ho...

For complete DBMS, check out this video: <a href=""https://youtu.be/YRnjGeQbsHQ"">https://youtu.be/YRnjGeQbsHQ</a>
In example problem 3, R(ABCDEF), relation R could be functionally determined from attribute B alone. B must be the only candidate key for the relation. Please verify.
In the 6th ques , total candidate keys are :- Y , WX, WY, XY, YZ , XZ
Sir please make one video more for practisr
In example 6 Y is the closure attribute and it gives the R then why we need to find closure of wx and xz ??
Thanks a lot sir your teaching is fantastic 😊
Sir this is easy, but i found some questions where there are no incomming edge but still candidate key, like<br>R={A,B,C,D,E}<br>FD={A-&gt;BC,<br>         CD-&gt;E,<br>         B-&gt;D,<br>         E-&gt;A}<br>Here no attribute have incomming edge... Still A and CD are candidate key
One of best lecture 🙏
Ques 3rd BF ke alawa AB to ho skta h
Thanks sir !! Superb explanation .
My day starts with colgate and ends with knowledge gate:)
amazing sir
BD cannot be a candidate key using B I cannot C and using D I can access only A and from A I cannot access C but using AB
at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=10m01s"">10:01</a>.......if we add A in BC then it will become ABC....... through ABC we can find the whole relation........ and through BC we can not find the whole relation....... so BC is not a proper subset of ABC......... so i think ABC should be the candidate key........ please solve my doubt sir!!
To find essential attributes....we can also check on the left of all relations &amp; see which attributes are not present there in the given relation
🤓🤓🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
Sir questions no 3 me single B (B+ = ABCDE)  aa rha hai toh  &quot;B&quot; akela candidate key h na kyuki minimal toh single B h na sir..

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=12m06s"">12:06</a>  Why only BF is candidate key ? (AB)+ = ABCDE <br>So AB should be also a candidate key !
Sir.. aap bahot aasani se sab samjha dete hai.. sahi me.. dil khush hojata hai.. 🙂👌
sir in 7th example BD closure works
wouldn&#39;t XW be also a CK? its closure also includes WXYZ :/
This is the best YouTube channel to learn DBMS
Sir, thora slow motion mein padhaiye,  concept clear nahi ho raha hai.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=9m01s"">9:01</a> My Dad after knowing my result
Thank you. Now I can find Candidate keys. Just because of you.
Please sir I will want a example video once again.
Sir in 3rd example at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=12m00s"">12:00</a> only B should be the candidate key na?
absolutely lovely video and thank you very much for helping us and taking so much pain for us ♥️
You have such a happy face sir. Keep smiling and keep helping us
nice video ,we can write algo for finding this using your logic
Sir in example 6 <br>W can also be in that key?
How to find CK&#39;s if there is no FD&#39;s???
Relation R has eight attributes ABCDEFGH. Fields of R contain only atomic values. <br>F={CH→G, A→BC, B→CFH, E→A, F→EG} is a set of functional dependencies (FDs) so that F<br>+<br> is<br>exactly the set of FDs that hold for R. <br>Q.54 How many candidate keys does the relation R have? <br>(A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 6 <br>Q.55 The relation R is <br>(A) in 1NF, but not in 2NF. (B) in 2NF, but not in 3NF. <br>(C) in 3NF, but not in BCNF. (D) in BCNF.
Candidate key ka 2nd question samajh m nahi aaya... BF kaise candidate key ho gaya.. Usk baad combination lene ki zaroorat kyu nahi h???
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=20m47s"">20:47</a>  Their will be (yx)^+→wyxz also my friend
Awesome
Har kisiko aane ka moka milega.<br>If you watched class attentively you will get it

Hates off to you sir, you are an amazing person. Thank you so much for these videos. From Pakistan.
🙏🙏🙏
Your videos are awesome sir....🙏
Sir your video make our day&#39;s<br>Thanks a lot
Sir in question 3 <br>B would be candidate key  , (  BF )  wouldn&#39;t be a candidate key  nah  ????
Asli B&amp;D to aaj kal news channels pe aa rahe h....
Gareebo ke maseeha.
Sir pls explain how to find candidate keys when FDS are not given
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=20m40s"">20:40</a> in the question 6th, C.K-&gt; {y, wx, wz} you have told but candidate key definition is minimal super key, According to this def.. C.K-&gt;[y] only. If i am wrong then correct me..
Sir ur effort is colossal, pls if possible teach us some more examples with complex one.
In example 5, only &#39;B&#39; is the candidate key, as it is the only essential attribute and closure of B gives us the complete relation too. And any further key, is just the superset of it. Please verify!! Thank You so much Sir!! You are the Best!! See, you made me an expert in this I guess. 😄
in 4th q (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=16m22s"">16:22</a>) the candicate key willbe B and D by b we can go to cd and using c to a and  by D we can go to b so it will be also a ck
ABD key reminded me Mr 360,the Ab devillliers
thank you for the special videos
Question number 2 mai.. AB to hai na candidate key phir hum dusra candidate key kyun dhund rehe hain???????
Yes sir
Every Semester we fortunately  get one superhero in youtube, for 6th  Semester you are the one Sir.
In question 6 ,  WZY candidate key should be included. Am I right ?
Thank you so much sir.....
Hey you 40 dislikers... I&#39;ll come to haunt you
Sir ek aur video...
Friends we just watch videos and move forward. But we don&#39;t realize what all hard work sanchit sir has done to make these videos. Sir you are one of the best teachers I have ever seen and friends this channel deserves more recognition.

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=9m04s"">9:04</a>  how can BD be a candidate key ?   Because to get D you need both A and B.  B alone cannot find D.
in 3rd candidate key will be B not BF
Do u have any more video on candidate key identification ? Plz share the link
Sir, iss tarike se diagram ke through hmm university main bhi kr sakte hai candidate key ko niklane ke liye, Sir pls give me asap becs my exam is coming soon.
sir,in first question ABC is also a candidate key ,because there is no proper subset of ABC?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inLVXPlSU&amp;t=2m06s"">2:06</a> video starts
Itne questions hi bahot hai
BF is the only candidate key.
kitna pakata hai bhai tu
In 6 th question closure of xwz
Sir thode or tough q bhi daliye na

sir, in dbms any key have null value or not
Excellent video... thanks a lot for taking so many examples.
wow sir, you are amazing. What an explanation...

I love.......  your vedios... Sir..... Ji........<br>Sir please make more vedios on tough questions to find candidate key 🙂🙃
U r best💟 no teacher can teach like u ...like d way u make things simpler...thank u soo much sir...no words in ur appreciation u r just awsome😄😄
Thankuu so much sir for making this video for us
Sir university ka syllabus v dekh ke chlye
in last example BDE <br>D gives AE then AB gives C then E can give F then all are derrived but why it cant be closure
Thank you sir!! You&#39;re a gem

Thank u so much sir for all the videos.. Ur way to teaching is very nice... I have watched every video for ur&#39;s from 3.1 to 3.13 n now i am able to solve questions...  Thanks alot..
i think ....<br><br>if we have to find without incoming  element then we not need to draw anything...we can see on left side ...if any element is not present then we can easily find the element.<br><br><br>Am I right
tq so much for ur valuable videos sir.Hope u support us in the same way.
In question 2 A and B also don&#39;t have any incoming edge.
You are the best SIR !

Sir if we are not given by FD&#39;s .we have only a relation which have 5 attributes and ABC is the candidate key of it .then how can be find no of possible super key.plz make a video on it.Thank you
sir.…. your teaching style is fab..
Sir v nyc video but in sixth question DE is not candidate key .

best teacher ever: sanchit sir
I Am not able to understand Update Anomaly.Because if HOD_Name is changing of CS branch then i can write query to change HOD_Name of Branch_Name like &quot;Update Table_Name set HOD_Name = &#39;ABC&#39; Where Branch_Name = &#39;CS&#39; &quot;
Out of context , but a thought which I want to say,<br>1. Why a concept has to be learned.<br>2. Right in the start, a brief overview of what has to be done and interdependencies b/w them.<br><br>I think these two things should implemented in our education system.<br>It will make things interesting , which otherwise is a burden.<br>Whole feels like rattafication.<br>The concept &quot;processing speed&quot; over &quot;storage&quot; .<br>This is my personal favourite reason to learn from sanchit sir and I am thankful to him for that.

Thanks sir g
Thank you very much sir .
This is the video we need but not the video we deserve.
@sanchit sir I have a doubt in instertion deletion anomalies. In insertion anomaly we know our table has branch field ,branch code field, and hod field if we even don&#39;t have a student in any branch we can easily add the new admitted student in table regardless of whether any student is already present in the database Or not. Then why you are saying that we cannot add a new student in the db table when there is no student of any branch already enrolled over there??
U r a great teacher sir
Show that how database anomalies can be removed, use appropriate examples?  plz write now
sir please upload in english
Sahi video!
Very nice and easy way to explain .good job done....
The disadvantage of slowness that you mentioned in the video doesnt looks to be correct. Because Denormalization is done for faster retreival.

Please sir write definition of all topic

bhai baap hai ye sabka
Wow nice teaching technique sir.
This is the only one and the best video series to learn normalization
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oylHRgBDfNc&amp;t=7m52s"">7:52</a>.... i was like aaj sutta zyada fuk liya kya sirji
dont talk in hindhi u dump
Cool
The explanation was very clear, specially on anomalies on un-normalized table. Would have been better if he had used Student_ID (as Primary Key on the first table) instead roll number which would be foreign key to the branch table (instead Branch code)
🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋<br>👍👍👍👍👍<br>Sir aap dark ink ka use kre <br>dekhne m dikkat hoti h<br><br><br><br>Thnks for your knowledge<br>🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Your teaching is superb sir.... I honestly would like to meet you some day and study one to one from you.
this is great video sir, I wish all the very best teaching skill is all about performing. you did well
Hello everyone , Please check out my channel for stuffs related to Matlab and machine learning .......and many more
Ur explanation was awsome..how simply u explained by taking small example.. anyone can understand easily irrespective of branch...thank you so much sir..🙏🙏🙏
Which type of relation is there between the foreign key and primary key??? <br>Like m:n , m:1 etc.
Sir u are best teacher.....
Superb Man ... I was looking for this since long
Best at 1.25X..:)
Great sir. Thanks a lot. Great explanation.
nice and very understandable video
About the modification anomaly, can&#39;t we use the query : UPDATE STUDENT SET HOD_NAME=&#39;PQR&#39; WHERE BR_NAME=&#39;CSE&#39; ; <br>Here we don&#39;t need to modify each tuple but all the tuples will be modified at once , in that case there&#39;ll be no modification anomalies. Isn&#39;t it?
suprb explanation like paisa vasool performance
Thnku sir....very nice vdo...
wonderful explanation..
aur chitkara walo, hogyi tyari?
Thanks a lot Sir..

Appreciated the way you teach &lt;3
How can a foreign key take reference from a attribute which is not a primary key
The content delivered per minute is huge. Sir speaks so fast yet everything is crystal clear in his mind. This is the reason student is easily able to grasp his words. When the teacher&#39;s fundamentals are clear, it shows in the video. Thank you Sanchit sir!!
👍 from India
Thank you so much sir for this information 😊
before i start watching any video by sanchit sir first i like the video then i start video. You are the best sir.
Awesome explanation. To the point.
Sir mujhe keval aapka hi explanation samajh aata hai , college ka kuch bhi nahi samajh aata hai.
one question, you created 2 tables from the student table, alright, should it not be 3 tables, one for students, one for branch and one for relation between student and branch? .. Also will it take less memory or more memory if we put third table? ... <br>asking the question from development point of view and not just exam point of view ?
Waw guru ji kitne achhe se smjhate ho aap mera kl exam h mai abhi pdh rahi hu hmari classes nahi lgi h khud se pdha h n ur useful video

Thanks !! For your great videos. Please explain at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80CcB9_HSxU&amp;t=7m50s"">7:50</a>, how can individual attribute of Composite Primary key be NULL ?
Ur always great. Sir
In the new table after doing 2NF, if there is a NULL value in B as seen in the first table, then how can it be a primary key in the new table that is created with B and C?
totally confused  ...tup explaining ..not easy way
The excellence of teaching is clearly depicted when he repeats the important concept every time and at the end of the video it just gets into the head without making an effort to remember.Thank you sir.
Doubt: Does this problem only occur when our primary key is a composite key(contains two columns) only?
This video is literal aag ........<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fire"">#fire</a>
Literally the best explanation,  THANK YOU.
Thank you sir ji
if AB is a candidate key, if we write primary key(A,B) in table ddl, then we cant insert null to A &amp; B either. can u plz elaborate this...
Nic explanation
This was supposed to be in hindi lol
Caption s hindi hata do sir
The title of the video should be Prerequiste of 2NF : Partial Dependency
It&#39;s awesome, just awesome. Thanks a lot.
hindi ku likha jab english hi bolni hy sara time barbad kr rahy ho sir
Hello anyone watching this video in2020. Well I am in TE so I need to watch.😅. Very nicely explained sir.
As you said in previous video that we cannot decompose AB-&gt;D as A-&gt;D and B-&gt;D so without  AB we cannot find D without  both the attributes <br>But in this video you said that if there is one attribute is missing we can still count it as primary key through this we can find the value of D? HOW IS IS PISSIBLE WE CAN FIND D ONLY WITH  A or B
Pura class English me liya, and title me likha hai &quot;in Hindi&quot; waah midi ji waah
thanks sir
Are not AB attributes composit key or concatenate key???<br>Because candidate key something different. Candidate key is not primary key. If it will be primary then its candidation condition will end.
Thank you so much sir... you makes us easily understand this with your great logics.....😇🙏👍
Your looks says you are born to be a teacher
could anybody tell me if (AB) is a candidate key, so it is not necessary for it to be NOT NULL,, so how come his explanation for partial dependency holds true.
Thank you sir ap k lecture buhat helpfull hota hain👍
now it seems why the hell i even tried to understand normalization somewhere else .U r truely a legend sir.I wonder how the subscribers hv not crossed a million.I have been struggling to understand this partial dependency for so long.And now I will never forget the concepts.Thanks a lot"

Sir again a doubt here would you plz explain this. To justify the partial dependency problem, you said that if AB is the candidate key and C depends only on B, then if B is null, C would be undeterminable even though AB is not null. That&#39;s why we need to decompose the table, but if it were truly to happen as you show in the next step then, for 1st table we have AB with AB as the candidate key and B as the candidate key in the second table. Here B cannot a key because it might be null and that&#39;s why we did the decomposition in the initial stage.
can you please help me out with R(ABCD) AB-&gt;CD ,D-&gt;A check 2NF
Thanks a lot Sir
maja aa gaya sir
❤️❤️♥️💕💕
A.C mangra h purty
hi sir
suppose B ka koi value null hai then hum is case me table kaise decompose krenge.. agar kiye bhi toh us case b us table ka candidate key hoga aur jo ki null nhi ho skta toh fir ye 2nf me bhi toh kam nhi karega na!!<br>Plz correct me if I am wrong..
OP sir .....ya to uski galat fehmi dur ho jaegi ya humari 😂😂
Sir, here A, B is a set of prime attribute so only unique values are allowed but you have taken a duplicate values
great teacher❤️
Thanks sir 😄
Gzb
Can candidate key have multiple null values?
Sir aapka neta waala tareeka ek no. h turant samazh me aagya😇
Sir, I just love the way you teach us....really appreciable.....I have learned so many things from your videos.....thank you❤<br><br>I have a doubt in this video..if you kindly tell me then it would be helpful for me..We know what is the problem if a table is not in 2NF and how to translate a table into 2NF....here, in the relation R AB is a candidate key..so both the key&#39;s value cannot be null..but individually can so....so if B has one null value in relation R and if we even do decompose the relation R into R1 and R2 then in the relation R2 there may be the null value of B because we are putting the same data from relation R to relation R2....So, how B individually can find C?
Thanks sir g
Thank you sir
B agr bol raha h ki wo c ko fetch kr lega mtlb kr lega iska mtlb wo kbhi null nhi hoga. Moral of the story ye h ki hum jabardasti suppose kr rahe h ki b null ho jaega

at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx5CzybyLXA&amp;t=9m08s"">9:08</a> if B will null, Then we can&#39;t find C. So What is solution for that? or Both A &amp; B must not be null is the only solution ? Please comment
Thanks sir 🙏
&quot;Jo neta bnna Chah RHA h use bnne do ya to uski galat fami door ho jaayegi ya hmari&quot;😂😂........nice sense of humour sir.

U r great sir
Everything is fine... But if you explain with some real-time example that could be more helpful...
Sir, the table you have given is having is showing functional dependency of AB -&gt; C; C--&gt;B along with B --&gt; C, but the schema we discussed is showing only B--&gt; C. The table is not showing as suitable example for the schema you drawn. Please explain and correct me with this issue.
I have a doubt please answer..at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx5CzybyLXA&amp;t=2m12s"">2:12</a>...you make AB as candidate key..but we can make A alone a candidate key..whereas B to C is given then also we can find all attributes ABC.. can&#39;t we make A alone as candidate key? please reply sir..
B to bahut chalaak nikla neta bann k party bana li apni C k saath..😄🙂.. good explanation sir g
thanku sir :)
Sir what if B is null. Then how will we decompose table
B bn gye neta 🤣🤣🤣🤣<br><br>BTW nice explanation 😊
sir plz bring MCQ series for NTA NET cs...on all topics..specially PYQs

Can there be same value multiple times in R1 table? The value C3 appears twice there.
AC--------&gt;B  has functional dependency.
R1 wale table Mei (ABC) ayega na, why only R1(AB)
Sir how u can find the particular column is partial attribute or nonpartial Attribute,
Very informative
Easy way ...<br>Very helpful vedio sir..👍👍👍

B ban gaya neta.....😄😄<br>Whaa sir
Is relation key is related to partial dependency
Thank you so much sir for your all videos because of only your video my  all  concept gets clear
Thanks sir ji😆
from column  A a gives 1 in coumn B and also a gives 3 how is it possible?
how can AB derives C?  A is not Candidate key
excellent sir,superb
I  the examle  functinal dependencies is only given b-&gt;c according this no one is super key so no candidate key but how can you assume ab without any dependencies.
Sir please explain in english. Difficult to understand in hindi
im confused....the title is in engilsh, but watching the video in a totally different language...even then I was still able to understand, but it just threw me off..
AB is not a candidate key in this, because they are not uniquely identify. Check row no 4th and 6th. And If I am wrong do correct me.
U r awsm! sir
Sir, I didn&#39;t quite get the last explanation. That agr ye ni krte to B beech mei kahi bhi Null ho jaate. Can you please explain?

try to teach in english it is benefit to all
After searching for long time Passing By Jenny&#39; Lectures , Gate Smashers etc at last I had to come to Sanchit Sir Only !!...He is a True Saviour of Students 👌👌👍
Great
For the given relation R(ABCDE) and F : {A-&gt;C, B-&gt;DE, D-&gt;C}, check which functional dependency (FD) violates the 2NF and decompose R into 2NF.
Waoo ! Great Explanation with no Boring <br>Love from Pakistan 😍😍
Love you
sir agr transitive propertieds ko separate tables mei likhe toh woh galat ho jayega kya? sir pls say very urgent
Brilliant explanation!
Thank You Sir.

Such an easy and amazing explanation 🥰
happy teachers day
Sir, you created a third relation(ABD) in first question. Could you please tell, why it was required?
best explanation sir..
Sorry, is it in English???
Your lectures appear to be ab upgraded version of normal university classes. Easy to understand languages and great explaination.
Woww Kamaal Dhamaal explanation. Thank you sir.
Do you mean that if there is partial dependency then we create separate table, but if there is transitive dependency then we include those attributes having transitive dependency in the table. Right ?
Sir in last example you have created R2 (A, I) for A --&gt; I, even you could have added I in R1 but you said there will be partial dependency that&#39;s why you made separate table R2. But in R3 you didn&#39;t make separate table for the dependency H --&gt; J and you added J in R3 . Sir please elaborate it ,
Great explanation ❤️
Thankyou So Much bs bhot bhot dhanyawaad sir
what if entire candidate key is creating partial dependency ?<br>Ex : -   AB --&gt; CDE,   B ---&gt; DE.<br>here c.k will be AB<br>therefore, prime attributes are : AB  and non prime attributes are : CDE<br>so AB and B will create partial dependency.<br>what will be the relations after decomposition to 2NF ?
Thank you so much sir.... everything 2nf is so easy now
Sanchit Sir is such a wonder teacher💯💯👍
I love you man

I watch all the advt to pay tribute to such an amazing teacher. He is like an angle for me.
Thanks a lot, Sir !!
grt explanation sir
In the last problem, R5 would be R5( A B D H J ), meanwhile R3( A D G H )
Thnx sir.excellent method of teaching.
I like the way u explain things but here i find it a wrong approach that u are comparing only with one Candidate key while there can be multiple CK
Sir, in 3rd question R2 is (A I) AND R3 (ADGHJ) THEN WE CAN INCLUDE i in r3 like this r3 (A,D,G,H,I,J) because  there is a dependency from A to I. plz replay
But 2 me 3 table me common kuch nahi hai

Sir kindly upload a video as you uploaded 1st normal form video with example of subjects I have to learn kindly its a request... I will wait for you.
dhanyabaad sir<br>it means a lot to us.
U have explained this concept in very easy way.Ur videos are really good
great job!! really helpful
Sir i love you
Thank you thank you thank you soooo muchhh for making these videossss❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
sir , if there exist more than 1 candidate key then how to decompose the table??
These are extremely helpful but sometimes does he switch languages? Not trying to be mean but sometimes I can&#39;t understand and idk if im missing out on info
tysm sir
Kon Kon Neta Ban ra h?
Learn alot form u sir
Very helpful sir
Thanks sir but also upload computer network series please thanks again
Neta bana do 😂😂😂😂 i m really fan of u
Can u cover the case with multiple candidate key
Very awesome video sir,if you can,make a video on decomposition of table into 2nf which contains multiple keys.
aap bhi jab namskar bolte hai to lgta hai aap neta bnne ki kosis kar rhe hai ......ab apko bhi neta bnna prega .....
Sir, I didn&#39;t get the concept of Identifying of NF.  How can we say that the questions in the above video ARE in 2NF?  Infact the questions are reduced to 1NF, hence must be in 1NF initially, which we are reducing in 2NF. ..

thank you very much sir , we are learning concept even a day before the exams all because of your playlist<br>love from AP<br>😍
you should upload the video of 4NF (Fourth normal form)
Is either A or B becomes null how can we find C then? And if we are able to find C with either A or B then its clearly a case of partial dependency! Pls rectify if i am wrong !
Nice explanation sir
You are &gt;&gt; our college professor thank you sir 😊

Even after qualifying GATE and reaching NIT Jamshedpur, watching these lectures to revise the old concepts. Thanks a lot sir.
I must say the way in which sir delivers the lecture is amazing.
Thank you sir
Excellent explanation. Thanks !
what if there are more than one candidate key?
i dont think c being null is the major problem , the major problem is that for different values of ab you can have same value of c and then it will lead to same value of d hence here is redundancy, so by making a separate tables abc and cd you are reducing redundancy
if the table is in N2F then does it mean that the primary attributes will be not null?
Best thing I learnt is Jo Neta ban raha h use banne do

Thankyou so much sir
thank u , sir!!
I enjoyed your class
Very nice effort. Although it was more effective if you gave example of real table
Your video is so helpful
Even non prime attributes can be null except the one from primary key, Am I right ?
Sir seriously u explain very beautifully kp doing videos sir tqs alot
excellent video as usual.I think u will never disappoint  your fans.Truely amazing
so here for 3rd normal form it is making non prime attribute prime so there wont be occurance of null value and we can directly find the value of the other non prime attribute through candidate keys. so if we make non prime   a prime attribute ,. Then it also becomes the part of candidate key!! . But while identifying candidate key , we see there is no incoming path  on they keys ,those we set as candidate keys.      So in conclusion can we  set it as a C as prime attribute .?   hope u get my doubt....
Khatarnaak sir.....give me sime energy please.,😆

Thank you so much sir, not even the college teachers could explain as great as you did. Tysm
Sir you taught keys, dependency. But it will be great if you give an example in form of tabular then you find functional dependency and from that super key, candid key. As long need to know of formula works. Please sir please
What happens If partial candidate key functionally depends on non prime attribute ?? Please help

But sir, I have a confusion that super key consists all the prime attributes and we say that a partial dependency exists when a proper subset  of our candidate key can retreive the value of other attribute, but that prime or proper subset of candidate key can also be the subset of super key. For example, if ABCD is superkey and BC is Candiadate key and  B has a partial dependency . Then B is also a proper subset of superkey at the same time.
Best Teacher 👍💯💯💯💯
Clarity++
Sachin: Your videos are crystal clear. At 11 min 15 secs in the video, u r telling to prove that &quot;either LHS is a SUPER KEY&quot; OR ... In this statement, can we replace SUPER KEY by CANDIDATE KEY? Have u kept Super Key deliberately?

hello sir if r u there then reply me i am going of GATE 2021 HOW can i prepare.
Thank u for ur efforts sir
but this example is already violating 2nf as c depends on b where b is and c are not a part of primary key?<br>Why have we introduced a new form then(i.e 3nf), can we have any example which is in 2nf but not in 3nf?
I have exam in two hours now n i am confident enough to solve it easily..........sabko neta banne dunga aur me pass hounga:)
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOZ5z7z9y-g&amp;t=10m23s"">10:23</a>, he says a super key cannot have a proper subset. But there is and it is called a candidate key.Slight mistake...otherwise the video is great.

Sir..at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOZ5z7z9y-g&amp;t=10m31s"">10:31</a> you said that...if we prove alpha is a superkey then transitive dependency will not hold because alpha ..being a part of key..cannot be non-prime.But.. Alpha being a superkey may not necessarily be a candidate key..and hence alpha might be a non-prime attribute.Sir,I am having doubt at this point.

Please note, A --&gt; B is fully functional dependency, not the partial dependency. Complete clarification is here ... <a href=""http://iips.icci.edu.iq/images/exam/databases-ramaz.pdf"">http://iips.icci.edu.iq/images/exam/databases-ramaz.pdf</a>

Doesn&#39;t this seem wrong? At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOZ5z7z9y-g&amp;t=10m23s"">10:23</a>, he says a super key cannot have a proper subset. But there is and it is called a candidate key [.](<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4519825/what-are-the-differences-between-a-superkey-and-a-candidate-key)"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4519825/what-are-the-differences-between-a-superkey-and-a-candidate-key)</a>. Correct me if I am wrong. <br>&amp;nbsp;<br> However the explanation is otherwise on point.

2nf mai nai hai A-B MAI partial dependecy hai as b is non prime and a is prime attribute
Abb karen kya??????
ek non prime ki himma itni badh jaye k wo dusra non prime ko find kre.. hhahahahaha
ek non prime ki itni himmat badh jaye ki wo ek non prime ko find kr sake...
how can beta be a prime attribute? we know that a prime attribute is the one that does not depend on anything.
Please can you also do in English

Great sir <br>Now all doubts are cleared 🙏🙏🙏
Bookish language had made these topics so much difficult, thanks a lot sir for these videos
sir in example no 4, we found that AB -&gt;C proves that R is not in 3NF, so we decomposed AB -&gt;C i.e. R1(ABCI)  but sir here A is a prime attribute and it finds I which is a non prime attribute so there should be no problem but sir you have again decomposed R1 to R11 and R12. Why so sir?
Can i get the notes from somewhere?
Bhut complex h
well done sir
Sir 12: 22 mai (AC  )=&gt;  candidate key hai ki super key hai
Thanks a lot!
2nd question me sir apne  separate table nhi banayi  for candidate key  Why sir ?
amazing sir
ThankYou so much.
Hello, I have a question here. How do we deal with a case where there is a circular dependency that means in R(ABCD) we have given that A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, C-&gt;D, D-&gt;A....how do we find the candidate key in that relation and then convert it further into normal forms?
Best explanation 👍

Thanks sir g
Sir in question no 4 . There is mistake because sir here in R1 we decompose it but sir why because here candidate key is A ,so already the table is in 3 NF so why we decompose it into R11 and R12
Sab apna apna netagiri krne me lge h🤣🤣🤣🤣
sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H4aJqYyd9s&amp;t=17m41s"">17:41</a> you have mistakenly included ( A - I ) which is a partial dependency . 😎😎

Thank you sir
thanks
In question 1 .. R3 me jab AC Likha to D kyun nhi add Kia , C bhi to D ko determine Kar rha hai???<br><br>Ya isliye kyuki R2 me CD include Kar chuke Hain??
there&#39;s an easier way, find the minimal set and make a table out of those FDs that are now present in the minimal set.
Sir, can you kindly explain again why have you made the table R4(A,B,D) in decomposition ? I have a doubt in this part .
you are god. thank you for such wonderful explanation&lt;3
3rd example me BD and DE <br>Me decompose kiya gya but B Part of cadidate key and prime attribute ek non prime ko identify karra to ye toh 2nf me hi nai hai kaise 3nf me ho gya
Great sir..<br>Mai nai boht videos dakey hai but jis trha ap dill sy parhatay ho. Is trha koyi nhi parhata 💜<br>Thanks my all concepts have been cleared
What will we do if a prime and non-prime attributes altogether are finding a non-prime attribute?
Dear sir, Is this method(without solving for 2nf seperately) applicable in university exam . If yes then would it  provide full marks?
sir last me candidate key ka relation kyo nhi likha?<br>jldi batao sir tatti aari h
Sir if humne 3nf me decompose krne waqt ek relation me candidate key ko Bhi rakhte but sir if agar aisa relation mile jaha par ek hi letter ki ck ho tb kya uss suppose only &#39;A&#39; toh waha pe relation kese bnega
The beauty of the video increases if you watch in 1.75x
Best explanation sir, it will helps me a lot in fourtcoming exam .Thank you sir
Ye 34 chutiya dislike wale  pka urdu medium wale honge
How do we decompose this relation? R(ABCD) F = {AB → C; BCD → A; D → A; B → C} The candidate key is BD.

Thank you sir 🙏
This is priceless!
Sir you are the best teacher
Sir you have not explained the case wherin we can get two candidate keys
Instead of checking further can we directly say , Every function dependency is divided into separate table and if key is not part of this then create 1 more table for key..?? <br>Is it a correct?
You r the best teacher  <br>Thanku so much sir<br>Thanks 🙏 Sir
Bahut pasand ai hai
Nice explnaition
Sir....sabse last question me aapne R4 relation decomposition ke dauran BD ko primary key kyun liya...ise kindly clearly explain kar dein...

Kya ye method se semester exam me solve kr skte h????....jldi bta dijye...mera exam 30 may ko h
Thanku sir..we love you knowledge gate
in 2nd and 3rd example why we are not creating a separate relation with only keys i.e. R(AB) when AB is a candidate key.. unlike 1st and previous examples?
Sir you are great. 💖
R22 Mei koi bhi candidate key ka attribute nahi hai sir ,,, then won&#39;t it be lossy ? ??
B ban rha hai neta...to use bnayenge hm neta...hahhahahhaha
Sir, plzz plzz make videos on 4th normal form also

If candidate key consist of one attribute then it is also prime attribute in this case p can determine np and still be in 2nf

How can (AB) and (AC) be candidate key when a subset of it A is itself a superkey. Then A must be a candidate key.??

bada vla thankuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu so much
Great Lecture Sir!!!!
Why is this on my soundboard
Should that &quot;alpha&quot; be a super key or candidat key?
Thank you sir
It would make things so much more easier if you can explain it using an employee table or student table
sir left side always be a super key i.e. if lhs is prime attribute so there is no problem but the lhs should not be non-prime attribute but your telling that lhs can be prime or non prime which is wrong i think !!

Sir you are boom , I saw your viedo at 2x speed but still I get the things at once only , thankyou sir for making normalisation easy.👍🙏🏻
You are Great Teacher Sir!!!....so much dedication and so clear concept, thanks for such videos Sir!!
I have a doubt i hope you would see this message and reply me. before designing relational model we design the er model but when we come to relational model we decompose some tables and then no no of tables will imcrese then in that case the number of entities in er model will be different from the number of relation in relation model since the entities of er diagram is converted to a table in relation model then how can we say that this er model logically reprents the final database?? I hope you will reply me soon sir.
Sir, How to solve it, I mean how we will convert 3NF to BCNF

sorry not satisfied may be next video will create logic for BCND
I just wish u how lucky I would be if uh were my cs teacher.
@Sanchit Sir I am confused about this video. Why you choose AC as CK because C has an incoming edge. I think only AB should be a candidate key ??
why incomplete video sir?
Hindi h yh tumhari😑😑😑😑
From AB we can find C and from C we can find B. I laughed so hard on this!

Sir why have you removed the videos from this playlist as earlier 165 videos were there in this playlist.😭
Sir ye table 3nf mai kesa hoga <br>3nf ke condition toh N.p- N.p ha ???
Very very helpful lectures Sir.......💯💯💯👍
I have one doubt in this solution. Here AB and AC are candidate/super keys and while identifying in which form the relations are in, for BCNF we check whether the left side of FD is a super key. Now here our final relations are AC and CB, well AC is a candidate key, but CB is not a candidate key or super key, so how come this satisfies the super key condition, thus making it BCNF. Please explain I am really confused here.
hello sir, awesome explaination <br>but i have a small doubt ,is the table given in video is in 3nf?<br>according to 1st rule it has transitive dependency so it shouldn&#39;t be in 3nf<br>but according to 2nd rule since ab is super key and b is prime atrribute it is 3nf .<br>which is correct?
Sir why you said AC is candidate key because AB already a candidate key as well I will find all the attributes with AB candidate key . I mean all the relation like AB-ABC
arre sir neta toh aap ho DBMS ke !!
Can we use R2 (AB --&gt; C) with R1(C --&gt; B)? This way we have common attribute in both the schemas and there is no FD loss and its also in BCNF form.. what say?
sir what a explanation love you sir<br>please keep making this type of easy to understand stuff<br>thank you very much<br><br>-- a general gate aspirant
Thank you So Much for your efforts and great lectures.
I don&#39;t understand why ac will also key
B and C Have incoming edges and we hav taken Ab and AC as candidate key is this correct<br>but Ab and AC closer is giving the relation R so this is also correct
Sir, you are really great. Cleared all the doubts. Thanks a ton

sir how it is in  3NF because c is part of canditate key  then how it is possible ?

I am confused. You should describe what case your are setting first<br>AB CK <br>Or<br>AC CK.

Sir i want to suggest you something that the website i have mentioned below provide the notes as you describe in your vedios so i want you to firstly check the content and is it&#39;s reliable and if you can mention this in your vedio  it will be great for the student as they can get  better notes   👇<br><a href=""https://beginnersbook.com/2015/05/normalization-in-dbms/"">https://beginnersbook.com/2015/05/normalization-in-dbms/</a>
It&#39;s all about ok bt after making table of only A and C..we can find multiple values through c...like c=&gt;z and c=&gt;w as well as ....how???
in the first table there is dependancy A-&gt;C  but A has duplicate values(c) in the column.<br>can u explain it?
ABC table bnna chhaiye tha.. But you took only AB... Please reply sir

I have watched all your videos but there is one question . How C is a proper subset of candidate key (AC), since C alone is unable to  find other attributes (A,B).
Please like share...
Why another relation ABC not there
teacher-What is normalization ? <br>me-&quot;jo neta banna chahta hai use banne do..&quot;
Sir u r great ....
Sir it is not dependency preserving decomposition so make Second table as AB not AC then it will be dependency preserving ,love you sir
Make video of 4 th normal form also
Jo neta banna chahta hai use neta banado 😂<br>Superb sir superb 👌🏻👏🏻<br>I want u as my professor
Why r making (A &amp;C) attribute as a candidate key....? C attribute can find B attribute by it self..! explain that first..?
Intro theme reminds me of MARIO....
I owe you my semester grades, sir. &lt;3
I dont get things u r saying in hindi...i dont understand hindi.mso plzz do lectures in english <a href=""http://only.so/"">only.so</a> that everyone could understand u..

How B is not a key in AB and CB
THQ sir your each and every lecture beneficial for my exam.. ❤️❤️🔥💯
Sir i think u made a mistake when u wrote R3(AB), it should be R3(ABC) bcoz AB-&gt;C . And then C would be common b/w R1 and R3 and C is candidate key of R1 also . So we could have included R3.
thnk u sir , for ur free means of knowledge sharing
Sir can you please tell tha if there are two candidates keys then what are the steps to decompose a table. <br>For ex .if r(a,b,c,d)<br>And fd=&gt;ac-&gt;bd,bc-&gt;ad,b-&gt;a,a-&gt;b.<br>And the candidates keys are ac and bc
How can ac be a candidate key because from ab-&gt;c and then a-&gt;c then c-&gt;b but a is the part of ab and a cant find alone c ??
how this example is 3NF in this example C to B which is non prime to prime so how can it be  3NF please explain??????
Knowledge Guruji😁
Sir, in the table AC, where A is acting as a candidate key, there is an inconsistency i.e. on same value of  &#39;c&#39;, there are two values  i.e. &#39;z&#39; and &#39;w&#39;, so, how to remove this inconsistency?
you have always been a stress buster whenever i am stuck with a concept that too ,the night before my exams :D thanks!
Actually I am confused here related wth 3NF.. itz in 3NF because there is no transitivity rit ? Means since C determine B and both are prime attributes so it avoids transitivity (non prime determine non prime) .. correct me If I am wrong Sanchit ?
Wow! Amazing!!!
Regards. This is excellent !!!
Jo neta ban na chahta hai usko neta bana de :P
The table made by u is not correct, Becz in it column a is giving two values for c, ie w and z, please tell me about this
Sir when u made relation R3 (AB) then why didn&#39;t u mention C in that as C is entirely dependent on AB?
Aap har tough topic ko itna easily samjha dete h....u r great....Sach me..u r great
Nice video sir,  but make a video for 4nf
Can you please upload a video on 4NF.
In AC table, c has 2 values z and w !!! its not in 1nf right? how did normalization helped here?
This is the best lecture for the topics I have studied, but there is too much add which is very irritating... like add after every 2-3 min is very irritating.. please do something to just reduce the frequency of add. Thank you
We went on distributing sweets to our college teachers upon placement..Then I felt the one who deserved them most were channels like yours, Ravindrababu sir etc..Thanks Sir !!
Add htao master ji
very good explanation sir
Learn some new concepts today.<br>Thanks sir ji😆
but c is not a super key...so that means this is still not in bcnf. isn&#39;t it?
thank you, sir... Actually, I am a Keralite. I don&#39;t know much more Hindi. Then too I can understand these topics.  Your way of explanation is very nice .
sir how c became key ?
what is the &quot;nehihe&quot;????????????
Thank you so much sir... I&#39;m feeling confident now for my exam...
sir g inner outer join bhi btaa do sir g..... poore you tube per kisi bhi teacher ka samjh m nhi aa raha g
sir g users kitne hote h g or kon kon kya kya karta h g ... aik chhota sa lecture unka bana dijiye sir pls
sir g locking base protocol bata dijiye net exam nazdik h g......  or sir g thank you very much ... m apke lectures se hi padh raha hu g. aap bahut achha padhate h g.... but sir jitna achha yaha per samjh m aata h utna class m kyu nhi aata g ... waha bhi toh  Hume aap hi padhate ho g.
thank you very much sir for this video
sir you are the best ! na aapke jaisa koi hua tha na hoga
Sir please upload videos on multilevel indexing thanks?

thank u sir
Thanks 🙏  for this
best explanation..
🙏🙏❤️❤️💕💕
Sir In example no.5 wrong candidate key is being defined in the video at time 22.04
Sanchit sir you are my inspiration you are the best teacher  from you any student will be wiling to learn <br>I just love your vedios crisp explanation thank you sir you are the best🤩🙏🙏
ty
Thank you so much for a crystal clear explanation!<br>It helped me so much in clearing the concepts!
Great Lecture Sir!!!
thank you so much sir, my exams are approaching. And you have explained so well....<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23saviour"">#saviour</a>
you are a GEM... I understood these concepts finally &lt;3
Sir&#39;s favorite dialogue &quot;YOU SEE&quot;
In the last question  it would be in 3.N.F , because  B.C.N.F does not allow any sort of &quot; PRIME ATTRIBUTE &quot; , on its R.H.S ( Dependant Part )
Simply just one word.<br>Excellent.
Sir can we say if there is dependency like AB-&gt;CD then we can write it as A-&gt;C,A-&gt;D,B-&gt;C,B-&gt;D?
Sir, in the 3rd example I am feeling doubt as you are saying &quot;DC&quot; are a non-prime attributes but &quot;BDC&quot; is a candidate key in itself at you said <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzxnbsmIRNw&amp;t=17m04s"">17:04</a> &quot;DC&quot; is not a part of candidate key!, sir please help
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzxnbsmIRNw&amp;t=28m09s"">28:09</a> can anyone explain please?
just one think to say<br>Thank You

Your video is very confusing
in the 8th problem I&#39;m not able to get how we concluded that ABD-&gt;E is a transitive dependency
Nice👍
Thanks sir g
diamond
sir didn&#39;t understand how u got the candidate key for 3rd example
I can&#39;t believe myself solving all examples which I&#39;ve feared only by looking at them.  ☺️<br><br>It&#39;s hard not to comment.<br>Thank you sir ❤️
You&#39;re  awesome!
Sir pure Hindi language ka use kra karo🙏
Awesome....
i think 6th question is in 1st normal form becasue &#39;E&#39; is non prime attribute in 1st dependency can any one explain?
Thank you sir. watching whole video was worthy
Sir are these videos enough for gate
Very good teaching sir..you teach very well..because i dont understand the concept of normalization but after watching your videos, I can solve all the questions of normal form. Thank you sir
A great salute..!!! Hats off to you sir...an amazing human being with gifted talent of teaching ,making efforts to give this knowledge.THANK YOU SIR FOR ALL THESE VIDEOS
Thank you so much sir....I am doing this like homework in my notebook with interest..... Thanks again to spread knowledge free....u r great 😇👍
In the bottom-up approach, since, we have checked for BCNF before, and we found out that alpha is not a key, we then went on to check 3NF, so instead of checking if alpha is a key (which we already figured that it&#39;s not), we can directly prove beta to be a prime attribute, right? That would save time.
Love you sir. Thanks for this video. This would be my third GATE attempt with job. I hope I ace this exam #171 days left
Salute to your explaining skills.. It helped me a lot...
Thank you sir. Easy to understand.
awesome
Thank you sir
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzxnbsmIRNw&amp;t=28m09s"">28:09</a> is a special case??<br>ABD-&gt;E is not a partial dependency even though A,B,D are individually prime attributes and E is non-prime?<br>bcause they are prime attributes but of different candidate keys?
Sir sara lecture urdu main btaya krayn ya urdu main or english dono main provide kr dia krayn
I have done this all question myself in less time due to your teaching style. Thank you sir....
Any NIT jalandhar student here?
Thankieeewwwww so much sir
Aap isme transitive dependecy kyu nhi check kar rhe sir
teaching technique is marvellous
Sir second last example cant be in 3nf because it is not in 2nf ... Check it plz
poora video to english me hai
Wahh...Kya baat hai (3 Idiots movie dialogue fits perfectly here) 😀
u make me understand very well....thanku so much sir.........
sir aap to humare senior ho  , DTU <br>awsm lecture&#39;s
I really enjoyed so much to watch this video.Welldone sir.Keep it up🙏👍👌🏻
You are great sir.
I&#39;m so thankful for these amazing videos. Please make videos on 4NF, 5NF, Multivalued dependency and DKNF
How to find 2nf<br>It contains what?<br>What to remove in 3nf
Candidate key is a minimal form of super key as sir has explained. So, at first we are finding out the minimal version of super key , i.e. candidate key, or any super key? Also, the Prime attribute that we need to check for 3NF...is the Prime attribute a part of a super key or necessarily a part of a Candidate key?
Thank you so much sir. You are Brilliant!
Best 👍💯
I think there&#39;s a bit mistake in checking 2nf in 3.
Hi Sir. In problem No 9:  none of the determinant is a super key, but how the FD Set is a BCNF??
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzxnbsmIRNw&amp;t=17m02s"">17:02</a> You said DC is not a part of Candidate key and Super Key and at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzxnbsmIRNw&amp;t=18m54s"">18:54</a> He said DC is a part of Candidate Key. Can someone please elaborate?
Can anyone please explain why A-&gt;DE in the first problem is not in 3NF ?
⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐
Your lecture video is filled with your passion to make the student understands the basic concept first and your way of interaction is just like real time viewing that makes us fully involved during the session , and of course without getting bored. I really appreciate your work. Thanks for your amazing teaching methodology.

Isn&#39;t yw a candidate key in q7?
This is pure gold!
I have questions in 6...this is in 3rd nrml frm.....but when i check 2 nf.....this is not in 2nf because of pd d to b......so how it is in 3rd nrml frm.....when it is not in 2nf????
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzxnbsmIRNw&amp;t=8m00s"">8:00</a>
Hello sir , in question 3 why BCD is also a candidate key at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzxnbsmIRNw&amp;t=30m32s"">30:32</a>
MUST SPEAK IN HINDI AS U HAVE WRITTEN IN CAPTION THAT IT IS A HINDI VDO
Sir, in question number 8 ,is the functional dependency ABD -&gt; E in 2NF ? I have this question because you said that ABD is not a part of a candidate key.
Thank you 3000
AB-&gt;CD,  AF-&gt;D,  DE-&gt;F,  C-&gt;G,  F-&gt;E,  G-&gt;A which of the following option is false?????? <br>(CF)+= (ACDEFG) <br>(BG) += (ABCDG) <br>(AF) += (ACDEFG) <br>(AB) += ( ACDFG)
if ab is a candidate key of e(abcd) then bdc can be a candidate key?
i am not able to got it please speak slowly
sir, you said in 3NF  Non-prime finds Non-prime but in the second problem you can&#39;t follow that rule...why?
Sir, you are God&#39;s own creation ! :)
Thanks a lot Sir! Ur lectures really help me I understand it very well but when the questions is in attributes form I&#39;m not able to understand it so kindly guide me in the following question<br><br>Consider the following database relations containing the attributes<br><br>Book_id<br>Subject_Category_of_book<br>Name_of_Author<br>Nationality_of_Author<br>With Book_id as the primary key.<br><br>What is the highest normal form satisfied by this relation?<br><br>Suppose the attributes Book_title and Author_address are added to the relation, and the primary key is changed to {Name_of_Author, Book_title}, what will be the highest normal form satisfied by the relation?

2nd problem m AB and BA dono same hi to h.. Then alg alg likhne ki jrurt hogi kya? ... I think the candidate keys are AB and BC... Can anyone help?
Sir, <br>a small request if the given relations are not in BCNF convert them to BCNF for all these examples and make a video it helps a lot sir
Thanks!
😀
Sir but isme toh candidate key ko bas dekhte h na? na ki superkey ko ??
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeWSmSH5YeI&amp;t=4m50s"">4:50</a> isn&#39;t the candidate key should be AB, BC instead of AB, BC 😶 in 2nd question <br>ANYWAYS REALLY HELPFUL
Error in 2 nd example. C. K={BC, BA}
Excellent lecture 👍<br>Thank you sir 🙏❤️
thank you sir you are doing such a great job. you made easy such a complex topic. thank you so much &lt;3
Thank you Sir
Best Lecture everrrr!!!
awesome  sir
Within 10 sec i got thnk u sir only foruuu❣️❣️🙏
For 8th QUESTION  , R( VWXYZ ) , here only one CANDIDATE ( i.e  PRIMARY KEY ) KEY exists that is : ( VW ) ,so XW is not a CANDIDATE  here as &quot; W &quot; is idecomposible  , hence X to Y , dependency can not be treated  as PARTIAL.  So  the RELATION , given in 2N.F without any further doubt.
Thank you for sharing your valuable knowledge
Awesome series of functional dependency and normalization sir
Is Wednesday mera final university exam hy or in normalization k lectures k bad i am sure k me exams me questions attempt kr lon gi Thanks a lot for giving us  that type of lectures<br>Jazakallah <br>Your teaching method is so good🥰<br>May Allah bless you always Ameen❤
maine video ko pause krke within 4 minute questions right kiye ,thankyou so much sir
Aap best ho sir. Thanks a lot!
Sir second question u have done wrong candidate keys are : AB, BC
Thanks sir 👍
Problem 2 ka candidate key dekhiye...<br>AB  to hoga lekin kya BA hoga ya BC hoga
Thanks sir g
Best Teacher on Youtube
in q6, AC is candidate key NOT AE
Thank you sir very well explained
For those who are wondering for correct answer to Problem 2) R (ABC). It is in 3rd NF and two Candidate keys are AB and BC. B is essential key.
There could be 3 more candidate keys in example no 5, xy, wy, yz.. am i right?
Thanks, sir this question come in my today&#39;s hexaware test
Itna accha to aaj tak kuch nahi samajh aaya👌👌👌
Thank you very much sir.
Waah Bhai Waah!! 🙏 Thank you so much!!
In first question sir A should be a candidate key because it is minimal than other keys..... Please help me out
welliguessillbehere forawhile  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeWSmSH5YeI&amp;t=6m15s"">6:15</a> questions no 4- BC ---&gt; DE ,here E <br><br>Is none prime i.e Prime to Non prime( partial dependency) <br>So No 2NF it&#39;s 1NF
Sir in question no. 5  :<br>ZY is also a candidate key
in ques 7, is ab-&gt;c partial dependency.????
Relation R with an associated set of functional dependencies, F, is decomposed into BCNF. The redundancy (arising out of functional dependencies) in the resulting set of relations is  <br>(a) Zero <br>(b) More than zero but less than that of an equivalent 3NF decomposition <br>(c) Proportional to the size of F+<br>(d) Indeterminate<br>not understanding this question<br>kindly help
You are an amazing teacher Sanchit Sir, God bless you
how didi u get BC as candidate key in 1st sum?
Sir can you please solve how to identify normal form or how to decompose table to normal form with just having relation schema and we also have to find functional dependency
The best normal form of relation scheme R(A,B,C,D) along with the set of functional dependencies F={AB→C,AB→D,C→A,D→B} is can you please give me the correct answer of this question.?
sir,your videos are really very useful ...tysm sir for such a  great explanation...
Sir question no 5 ka candidate key Nikal kar dekha dijoa plz
Thnx lwde
Q5  mai  candidate key wrong hai kya?
In question 6 (A &amp;C )are essential attribute.<br>So AC will be the candidate key not AE.
Sir 5 question m candidate key sahi h kya
In first question only &#39;A&#39; should be the candidate key right?! Or am I missing something?
Can anyone give me a example of functional dependency which is in 2nf.... Plz help
Sir you are great 🙌
Sir aap table pr kyu nhi btate
If in question 7 there is partial dependency on candidate key n it is in 1NF, then there is partial dependency on candidate key  in question 4 as well, n how it is in 3nf
Sir, is logic se to kabhi koi Database 2NF me ho ga hi nahi?
In second question sir there is two candidate keys AB and AC
R(A B C D)  fds are :- {BC-&gt;A , ABC -&gt; D } which normal form is this in
can you tell me AB -&gt; B is in bcnf or not if ABD is candidate key
helpful!
🤑
Awesome
Isn&#39;t AB, the key, equivalent to BA, the key?
waao sir..You are great...I wish you are my dbms teacher in my college..then the dbms lecture will become my favorite
I think in Question 5 Candidate Key should be Y, XW, Z and so answer should be BCNF
Yes Sir
Really many many thanks sir i finally learn all about normalisation  clearly
Sanchit sir, i have a question that R (A B C) , A -&gt; BC and  C -&gt; A , now in this case you choose candidate key as AB and BA but according to your last video of finding candidate key , i got two candidate key that is AB and BC because B is the only attribute which does not contain any incoming. please let me know if i am wrong or Confused.
by the way you are a great teacher
sir at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeWSmSH5YeI&amp;t=3m35s"">3:35</a> the two keys are ab,bc not ab and ba,ab and ba is same
in first question how can A,BC,DEF be 3 candidate keys.Candidate keys is the minimal no?
Sir, in Q.2 candidate keys should be AB, BC right ? How it AB and BA ?
Sir you are great... please upload videos for computer networks
Respect and love from Pakistan sir
Thanks lot For such nice video.... <br>In Q. 5 i could not understand how xz is candidate key? Pls elaborate...
in second question how does BA comes as a candidate key????
This is the area in dbms where most of the student stuck but after going through your series it&#39;s look like a bacho wali chiz awsome sir🙏🙏🙏a big salute sir..
sir your adding series also awsm and help to clear more clearly the topic ............thank u so so mch and keep update more topics time to time
awsum sir....u r d best teacher on YouTube
You are a Master Piece.Please ,provide some videos on Transaction Locking <a href=""http://protocol.it/"">Protocol.It</a> will be great pleasure for me.
In 5th question ZY should also be the candidate keys.<br>Isn&#39;t it?
bhagwan aapka bhala kare.. ab candidate key, FD aur normal form to no problem at all.. thank you so much sir.. :)
sir fr the 3 rd  qustn  partial dependencies exist A--B  where A is partial key ryt ?
Please upload computer network lectures...
Sir, you clears all the doubts and make normalisation as easy as it was never. Thanku sir,
Sir plz upload computer network question
Sir mujhse iske second question me dout h kyuki BC ak condidate hoga jiske place me aap ne BA likh diya h
Sir, please upload lectures on Computer Organisation. That will be a great help. Thank you sir.
Sir, can you please upload &quot;Computer Network&quot; videos. It is mentioned in your about section but i am not able to find it. Please help me out. Your all other videos are amazing. Thanks.

Normalize it to the next higher<br>normal form. sir this question is confusing me lot
sir in last question there is one more candidate key which is ACD and if ACD is a candidate key the second dependency which is CD-&gt;EF  is a case of partial dependency so that schema is also in 1NF not in 2NF.<br>Please Correct me if i am wrong @KNOWLEDGE GATE .
In first Q candidate key will be CED.
Thank you very much sir 🙏
Thank you sir
Sir aap great ho
so so clear! amazing sir keep it up
i am able to solve any gate question all because of you sir. Thank you so much. :) &lt;3
last ques is in 1NF.. Please recheck it..
Thank u so much sir 😇🙏
Really well explained !
thank you so much sir,respect lot
why are we checking for 3 attribute CK when we got 2 attribute CK, CK is minimum attribute key. Right na?
last questions me 1NF hoga...you did it wrong...
Sir normal form aapki wajah se hi identify karna seekha hai....thanks a lot sir. God bless you always
i have a doubt in last question AB-&gt;CD shows partial dependency because AB-&gt;C,AB-&gt;D and AB-&gt;D is partial dependency
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL9-RDzvO-0&amp;t=24m27s"">24:27</a> how is it imp if 2 attr then its in BCNF...<br>e.g. A &amp; B be the attr<br>P.K. is (AB) and i have a F.D. A-&gt;B<br>this is 3nf ryt?
मैं सारा DBMS का आपका वीडियो देख रहा हूं<br>बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद सर
Sir please Hindi ma video daliya na
Thank u sir<br>Love u sir<br>For playlist
your the man
seriously damn good, better than my American professors
Sir myself Prabhat Yadav.......<br>Sir is video series me aapne btaya 6th question me ki ye 1NF me nhi h jbki last video Part 4.12 m aapne iska same question no. 7 btaya tha ki vo 1NF m hai........<br>Jb sir last video me DC-&gt; AE do me toot skta h jaise DC-&gt;A and DC-&gt; E waise hi aapne is video series 4.13 m kyu nhi ise toda 2 parts me i.e., AB-&gt;CD ko AB-&gt;C and AB-&gt;D agr ye b do parts m toot ta hai to ye b fir 1NF m aayega
Do u get monetized??
sir in this 4.13 no video in the 6th question (AB---&gt;CD),I think it should be in 1NF ,cause (AB)is a candidate key but in (AB--&gt;C) C is not a prime attribute,though D is prime .so sir how can it will be in 2NF??
I have a doubt. Third normal form is inadequate in situations where the relation <br>a) Has multiple candidate keys<br>b) Has candidate keys that are composite<br>c) Has overlapped candidate keys<br>d) None of the above<br>What should be the answer?
Dili öğrenip video çekin
I will always remember I owe you one. Thank you so much for your work, generosity, love and hard-work. We love you too. Someday I could thank you personally.<br><br>Now I just want to know, is it safe to say,<br><br>pk----&gt;pk<br>nk----&gt;nk<br><br>pk = prime key<br>nk = non prime key<br>Can both be ignored while deciding the NF?
Thanks a lot for your help
how to convert the 2nd question into 2NF ?<br>I am not able to do because in BC -&gt; D is of the form (P)(NP) -&gt; (P)
Very Clear Explanation with more Practice problems, Thank you very much.
Sir plz upload a video of relational calculus and it&#39;s queries ...this topic is  very confusing.🙏🙏
In 6th ques. c is non prime attribute so AB-&gt;C is partial dependency so not in 2nd NF it is still in 1st NF
in  4th example . for 2NF it also should be that all non key attributes must depend on key attribute. now c was not depending on A so how can it be 2NF
This unbelievable sir teaches me more than my professor!
Thank you so much sir, words merely aren&#39;t enough for the tough concepts that you have made very clear for us! Kindly make videos on B,B+ trees and also upload video on ER to Relational table translation.
and all we need is a teacher like u...thank u  so  much
sir when will you upload the part 15
you miss D in 1st example.please check it!

sir, thanks for ur wonderful videos but pls...<br>sir, pls recheck the question 6, i m getting confuse.... here BC-&gt;DEF, D is a prime so here prove that not in 2nd NF, after dat D-&gt;B , here also B is prime n also D is a part of candidate key... so 3 possibilities prove dat not is 2nd NF....<br>pls correct me if i&#39;m wrong........
Great sir
Wonderful way of presenting the information which makes us understand the concept very well!Thank you sir!
please upload few video on decomposition of relation to bcnf &amp; 3nf
y u have not taken D in the first example  as a part of candidate key but u have taken H in 2nd example both cant find anyone .

sir where is lac no15
thanks for this video sir ji😆
Hello sir in this series of 1st question u said it will hv 1 candidate key bt according to me it will have two plz clear d confusion.
thank you..
Thank you sir. Your lectures are awesome..thanks a lot
at final qus how is it possible AD also a candidate key? there is only two AB and <a href=""http://abc.am/"">ABC.Am</a> i right sir?
Thnku so much sir.....ur explainations method is very gud.
in the last question d -&gt; b is a p.d because key is ad. how it&#39;s not p.d ??
Sir in 2nd question i think BCEH will be also candidate key
Thank u so much , now itz very easy 4 me 2 solve
sir plz post a video regarding wid writing relational expression for give db queries
Superb explanation...
Is there no part 15?
don&#39;t we have to check whether cef as candidate key or not in the last question ???
I cannot thank you enough
Sir! You are too good.
sir in 2nd question why ACEH is not a c.k
In last question, 3rd functional dependency &quot; BC -&gt; DEF&quot;<br>let me decompose it for simplicity<br>BC - &gt; E<br>here E is non prime and it is depending on BC. where B is part of a key (AB) so it is the case of functional dependency! <br>pls clarify!
sir can you please help me for following question: <br>R(A,B,C,D,E)<br>Given FD&#39;S<br>AB-&gt;C<br>BC-&gt;D<br>CD-&gt;E<br>What normal form is for this relation?
awesome tutorial... really a great work. u washed away all my confusion.Thank you sir :)
Sir as you said that in 2NF, the condition is that it is partialy dependency but i question when you find partial dependency then tell to write 1NF why?
great job!! sir
A jornal uses (Volume,Number,StartPage,EndPage,Title,Year,Price)<br>Primary Key is(Volume,Number,StartPage,EndPage)<br>FD ARE-<br>Volume,,Numaber,StartPage,EndPage--&gt;Title<br>Volume,Number--&gt;Year<br>Volume,,Numaber,StartPage,EndPage--&gt;Price<br><br>It is in---<br>INF or 2NF<br>Sir Please Solve this<br>Because according to me it is 1 NF
Please upload lectures on computer organnisation as well
sir in Q 5. how is it in 2NF??<br>A-&gt;B <br>here A is a prime attribute while B is a non prime. so it&#39;s a case of partial dependency.
Ur teaching is excellent sir..✌👌👍.. 100/100 ✔
and in video 14.. question 4 why we check the other possibilities with length of 3 key even (from failure of lenght 2 candidate key) bcz  the candidate key is minimul super key so we got length 2 candidate key why we go for lenght 3 from failures from them..??
Sir you taught to find a candidate key we have to see essential attribute or we can say the attribute which don&#39;t have any incoming edge but what suppose to do if I get all attribute with incoming edge.?
Hello sir,<br>I have learned a lot from your videos and i like the way you are teaching point to point but why i am unable to find 15th video?
sir in the last question ..AB-&gt;C and D..now c is not a prime...so how it is in 2nf...<br>in the fourth qstn we have a situation where A-&gt;BC so A is giving B and C ..now C is a non prime attribute.. that&#39;s why it has became 1Nf...😅
Had a nice experience, appreciate your way of teaching. Teachers like you are rare. Thank you for making even a non CS student (me) understand DBMS basics, especially normalisation.
Sir, it would be very helpful if you could upload videos on relational algebra and ER model for DBMS.
in question no 2 . we can have (ACEH) and (BCEH) as candidate key , i think sir u have missed them . !
hello sir thanks for you videos<br>can you help me with this question?<br>R(A B C D E F G H I J K)<br>A---&gt; C D E<br>A B G H <del>---</del>&gt; F I J K<br>G H I J <del>---</del>&gt; A B F <br>this was my exam question, a) find a set of keys<br> b) normalize this table until you cannot further decompose it
hello sir thanks for you videos, i have an exam question if you have time to solve it, how can i send it?!
Sir,In which normal form relation would if it is not in BCNF and it not contains transitive dependency but contains partial dependency
Had a nice experience, appreciate your way of teaching. Teachers like you are rare. Thank you for making even a non CS student (me) understand DBMS basics, especially normalisation.
sir will you please teach lossy and lossless decomposition and dependency preserving
in ques 6 y to work with the ac+,ae+,af+..................we hv not done for d earlier questions 1,2,3,4,5
Awesome sir your lectures are very good.
In the 4th example why did we check for further candidate keys and didn&quot;t stop when we found all 2 attribute keys? I mean how do we know when we have to stop searching?
sir in 2nd ques why ACEH is not a candidate key.....??it is not a subset of EH and CEH...
Sir would you please add videos on Query Processing"

Well I have a question, In 3rd condition what you mention was about the uniqueness of common attribute B but I have a point, if the common attribute B is determining the value of C in table R2 then itself it will have unique value for C, otherwise dependency will not exist. Then what is the point to write the 3rd condition?

sir, Is lossless decomposition applicable only 5th normal form or for every normal form??
Thanks sir g
👍 thankyou sir you are great
thanks a ton
Sir how can we apply the lossless conditions for more than 2 decomposed tables?
sir if my table has a huge amount of attribute &amp; i decomposed that table then after combine of table how could i find that it is lossless or lossy. As checking each &amp; every attribute in a table will take a huge amount of time. Then how can i do this without wasting time

Hatsoff to this explaination sir.
Mandatory Properties<br>1. all attributes of the parent table, should be in child table.<br>2. there should be at least one common attribute in both tables.<br>3. the common attribute  should  have unique/distinct values which means that attribute should be candidate key.
Thanks a ton

Sanchit ji.. Real-time example se be explain Kiya karo Kabi tho... Hamesha a, b, c ke piche pade hui aap...
Sir but Jo last example m 1option h usme x candidate key Kaise hai bcz hum x se w prr nhi pahuch paa rhe hein toh WO  1 option b sure nhi h

Thanks sir g

100th comment❤️
common attribute  can be super key?? Anyone please
Nice explanation
love your explanation
Does anyone notices that he speaks very similar to technical guruji
sir in the 6th question R1(ABC),R2(BCD),R3(DE). If we combine R1 and R3 we get(ABCDE) but the intersection is null since there is nothing common in between them. So it should be Lossless decomposition.
sir 6th mr R1 and R2 saare attribute cover nhi kr rhe h E nhi h dono me ...aise ke skte h kia h sir??
Thank you sir.... great 🙏
Who&#39;s having exams tomorrow
Thanks a lot sir
Sir your teaching is fantabulous
Haat joda mat kijiye, we are blessed by you
sir in 4th ques we r getting w as candidate key in R2.i think  it is lossless.Plz kindly explain whether it is right or wrong

Thank you so much sir... Take a bow🙌
thank u
SIR YOU SPEAK TOO FAST !
Hello sir, in the last option of table of first question you calculated B as common between R1 and R2, but both of them has BC as common and C is not distinct, so it should be lossy.
In the last example how you can fetch W by making X as a candidate key?
sir you are really great..the way you explain all those stuffs its really beautiful and i becomes your big fan...<br>and i wanna say something that if possible then please upload videos on 4NF and 5NF.<br>Thank You Sir.
More questions on this topic will be helpful. Please upload soon if possible.
Yaar I need this reply as early as possible , can not wait for a month or many days.. plz help me
Also , just have one question , whether we need to find candidate key for whole schema R and then we need to check whether this candidate key is available in decomposed schema R1 or R2 , or <br>Whether we verify whether common attribute find by rule 2 , is candidate key in R2 or R2 ?
Sanchit , can we try to solve this problem ,<br>Suppose that we decompose the relation R=(A,B,C,D,E,F) into  three relations-     R1(C, D, E) , R2(A, B, C) and R3(A, D, F) .  Find whether this decomposition is lossless, if the following set F of functional dependencies holds.<br>F={ A-&gt;BC; C-&gt;DE; D-&gt;F}
Why why english tittle when you talk on another language ??? BIG DISLIKE
There&#39;s a mistake in the first part - Q6, wherein we have the three decompositions R1(a,b,c),R2(b,c,d) and R3(d,e). You say that the only common attribute between R1 and R2 is b, but it&#39;s actually b and c both!
Thank u so much sir...

Thanks sir ji😆
opetion 4 is correct
Thnku sir ji...
sir please upload videos on ER Model
May I know why 4th option is not crct for 2nd qn...? even it contains all attributes and vw ,it is also a candidate key.
how x is candidate key  when finding x closure w is missing in last question
How is X a candidate key? We cannot get W from X.
Sir i want more videos on dec omposition
and one more question:- does the child tables have to have the same C.K (a table can have multiple C.K )in common to satisfy the condition of loss-less decomposition
sir i have a question :- since here we can find C.K with the help of functional dependency here so 1st we find the C.K and then check that the decomposed tables have those keys in common or not
Hello sir, in the last option of table you calculated B as common between R1 and R2, but both of them has BC as common, still they satisfy 3rd condition?? Since C is not distinct. Please clarify.
Brilliant sir thanks

Thank you sir❤<br>Sir I have a doubt at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isOLwsdB4Ns&amp;t=14m17s"">14:17</a> if we use pseudo dependency that is D finds A... BD finds CD then BA Finds CD hence dependency preserved
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THANKS A LOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How  in 3rd example have such decomposition. AB is the candidate key, and if you do decomposition based on candicate key and FDs then one should get R1(ABC) and R2(AD) as lossless decomposition. Decomposition given in your example is wrong as it is not lossless decomposition, it is in fact loosy decomposition.
great sir

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Zwz4lKmDU&amp;t=8m32s"">8:32</a> i don&#39;t think it is bcnf because rhs is not primary
sir, as per your lectures, A table must be in BCNF , if all dependencies &#39;Alpha&quot; side is super key. Then why at  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Zwz4lKmDU&amp;t=8m21s"">8:21</a> , it is true for 5 dependencies. i means their alpha side is not super key because our candidate key was (AB)+ only.<br>Please let me know after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Zwz4lKmDU&amp;t=8m21s"">8:21</a> , what will be keys for tables?<br>i mean will D and F also become keys after decomposition into BCNF? PLease answer my doubt.
Thank You so much, sir! You&#39;re amazing!

Sir please upload one video for multivalued dependency
Sanchit sir your videos are very helpful and interesting and very very easy to understand. Please upload  video on multivalued dependency 4nf and 5nf too.
I have a question, can any one reply ? After finding the candidate key, we decompose to 2nd normal form. Now A being the prime attribute for R2 relation (ADEIJ) A to D is a case of partial dependency which is not allowed in 2nd normal form.. Can any one give the clear explanation ?
To all those asking why it is in BCNF. <br>We don&#39;t have to check &#39;AB&#39; as the Candidate Key. Instead, after every decomposition, the candidate key varies with the table. <br>e.g. in R21(ADE) A can derive all the attributes i.e. D and E. Therefore A is the CK of that particular table.
Strong &amp; Weak Entity Set? Where are these? Traps also missing from lectures.<br>Sir please upload lectures on these topics. And also upload practice problems on ER-Model.
Dependency preserving decomposition pe practice problems not yet sir.....
How this is in BCNF Sir?bcoz candidate key is only AB.....
How is the resultant table in BCNF?
How can we say this table is in BCNF? I didn&#39;t get because, to be in BCNF, alpha must be a  C.K./S.K. ??
Loved every bit of this playlist sir thankyou
Sir for third normal form @-&gt;beta  @ should be superkey or beta should be Prime attribute but in case of R(DIJ) and R(FGH) niether D and F is super key and nor IJ and GH are the prime attribute so how can we say both table are also in third normal form?
what is there are 2 candidate keys . How do we solve it?
Can anyone explain how it is in bcnf?
For BCNF<br>alpha or left side must be superkey. right?<br>at last ,after 3NF.  alpha or left side is not super key rather it is part of candidate key. and you are saying it is in BCNF?
SIR A BILLION TIMES TY!!!!!! &lt;3
sir please upload videos of locking
thanks for clear cut video
Sir my college teacher who can&#39;t able to do the work in 6 months , sir you have done it in 1 day.....You are great sir. I will be very great full if someday i can meet with you. Thank you sir...
sir you look so happy while teaching . the same smile is on our face when we understand each and every word of your lectures.thank you for making such great videos <br>it helps alot.
in R21 A is not super key?so how it can be in bcnf?cz in previous lecture u told that alpha should be super key for bcnf
Watched entire series, loved the video
Thank you so much! You are very good at explaining and the structure of your description is very organized!
Thanks.. It&#39;ll help for the semesters
sirr u r the best......
Thanku sir
the very last tables computed are not in bcnf....only R(abc) is
Thanks sir.... you are great
How are the tables R(21,22,31,32) in BCNF form? They dont have Candidate keys in the LHS.
Sir please ans my question urgently.. my exam is very close please sir please.. <br>How can we decompose a table with certain data which is in 1nf where FD is not given to us? Please sir ans my question
&quot;A&quot; is not connected to &quot;D&quot; in the very first given 1st NF
Sir, if the primary key itself is mentioned in the question, should I first find all the rest candidate keys and then proceed or should I just continue with the given key ?
Make a video about 4th Normal Form
this makes no sence, why does A have an influence on D? surely you switched C and D
Relation R(ABCDE) with functional dependencies A--&gt;B, B--&gt;C, C--&gt;D,D--&gt;E hold then what is the highest normal form that R holds. Is the answer R is in 2NF right. Please let me know
normlygetion me same pari me kisi ke nub. badte h ya kisi ke kam hote h esa hota h kya
sir, there is not sk or ck, then how can u prove it in bcnf?
As superb as always!!
sir plzz make on video on er diagram
You definitely are better than so many uni lecturers out there. Thanks a ton :).
sorry i understood yes AB-&gt;C as i didnt notice that B line...
sir you have taken AB-&gt;C in R1 but sir look initially only A is determining C----I think this is a mistake here......correct me if i am wrong.<br>thnks
Thank you Sir! You made me clear about 3NF very easily.
sir  really thanks to  all of your effort and hardwork that you did  for the  students at free of cost really it means a lot for us and we really appreciate your efforts thanks a lot
Sr plzz upload videos on dependency preserving
Sir, please upload videos with more examples on decomposition of tables into normal forms.
Hi Sanchit - Thanks alot for your educational videos. Could you please upload some more examples of how to we go about decomposing a table into a desired normal form (e.g 3NF, BCNF). Looking forward to more of your education video. They are really helpful. Keep it up!!
Gaar mara le
Where is part 15????
why is it in BCNF?
F=ab-&gt;cdef, c-&gt;a,d-&gt;b,c-&gt;d,e-&gt;f and b-&gt;e....find the normal form..here every atrribute has incoming arrow what to do ?
Sir ur videos are so fruitful that it clears many of my concepts of DBMS....Sir plz do share ur video on dependency preserving as it is not there...Plz do favour to many of us
sir i dont understand the logic how D become a candidate key.
u haven&#39;t made videos on 4 and 5 NF sir??!!!
amazing lectures! saved my day! LOVE FROM PAKISTAN &lt;3
@Knowledge Gate, I don&#39;t understand why the tables past the 3NF ARE ALREADY IN BCNF? As I was basically trying to apply the rule you said in the previous lectures for BCNF : if alpha is superkey and Beta depends on alpha for all relations then it&#39;s in BCNF but that&#39;s not the case here.<br><br>A is not superkey but a prime attribute , so how does A --&gt; D, E   be in 3NF and same logic applies to the other relation tables.
thanks you so much sir your session are very helpful to me
&#39;loseless join decomposition and dependency preserving decomposition&#39; .. sir have you removed this video? Please add it into playlist
pls. pls. consider sql queries also. nested queries and all
Can you solve this please..  <a href=""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/isro-isro-cs-2017-question-15/"">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/isro-isro-cs-2017-question-15/</a><br><br>Cause as far as i understood<br>No faculty member within a single department has same name = facName , dept-&gt; office, rank, dateHired<br><br>Each faculty member has only one office identified in office = facName -&gt; office<br><br>which is not in 2nf<br><br>I think answer must be D)<br><br>Because here is in 2nd FD there is a case of Partial Dependency since Faculty,Department is the candidate key according to the question infer in first dependency.
thanks sir ji
Hello sir, <br>I am unable to find part 15 of this series of lecture...pls help me find it..am unable to understand how to decompose a table into desired normal form.
Sir1 4n n 5nf  plz upload
sir you made my exam amazing :) Thank you so much :)
where i part 15
i can not find part 15 of DBMS
thank u so much for the clear explanation . Now i&#39;m totally clear about the whole topic of functional dependencies and normalization.Grt job.
Where is part15 sir??
im not finding part 15 of these vedio lectures.

The concept is deeply explained....
Ye duster kaise chipak gya 💀
In UNSORTED FILE STORING &quot;INSERTION&#39; MAY BE DONE IN SIMPLER WAY , BUT DELETION FOR A PARTICULAR FILE CAN NOT BE DONE.
In traditional ALGORITHM for INSERT or DELETE a RANDOM FILE in a unsorted  DATABASE requires O(constant) = 1 , but LOGICALLY if we have to push in at FRONT or at REAR , it might get same time span , but to do the same in the MIDDLE SPACE (ARBITARILY) it may  require more time than previous two cases , I guess. Please answer me sir , if you feel free.
Thanks sir

I don&#39;t understand why it will be expensive to insert or delete in a sorted file, if we consider a sorted file like a sorted array which can grow on either side then, we can also consider it as an array representation of a balanced binary tree, and there you go we can do it at O(lg N) time which is very very fast.
Your videos are awesome. You are really a great teacher. Thank you for making videos for us. And providing all this material for free.
sir can you please make a video on multi key file organization

Great elucidation!!

index to book ke ager hota hai. 😧😕
Very nice explanation 🙏👍
Waah 👌
What if records are sorted and some of the records are missing?<br>For example: We have a record with ids : 1 - 100.<br>And records with ids 22, 27, 55, 75, 86 are missing. <br>Then also it stores index in this order: 1, 11 ,21,31,41,51,61...?
I didn&#39;t get the thing, index file store some particular attribute and table will have all attributes, when we fire a query against some particular attribute, then in table  also, it will search for that attribute only, so why is it fast in index file than actual table?? How other attributes present in the actual table affects searching??
Search attributes and block pointers
Best
Nice explanation 👌
Thank you sir for making this concept so clear
Please do videos only in English which is more helpful sir!
Please do in English also
Very clearly explained Sir..
Thank
Unsorted hai to timestamp k basis mai indexing karr sakte hai ??

Please speak only English in your video series. Most people do not understand Indian.
Can a table have multiple indexes ?
The quality of explanation is so good that those ones who hardly understands Hindi are able to get a better understanding about the core topics. Thank you sir for this service. It&#39;s a great help for every student in the country. May god bless you
This is just wow
Tomorrow is my exam.
Explain very well..... But takes long time to explain..... So waste time....
Watching one day before exam in 1.5x speed😎
Sir sometimes you give  very unnecessary examples,  you can explore more technically instead them , (NOT ALWAYS)<br>And thank you for making good videos
Sir, That background sound like buzz.. sound is so annoying. All the concepts are clear.
Do I need to do indexing on all the column or Will it is fine to do it on the primary key only?
Can you explain b+tree
mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell.
may you live long ....!     your effort is truly capable for appreciate
The video was awesome but there are some doubt uncleared till end of the video<br><br><br>1. What would be the S.K (Search Key)<br><br>2. Generally we access the database by filter in the query based on different attribites and this makes S.K non-specific.
confusing.....
hii sanchit sir i m watching all ur videos  it is more than awesome Thank you God  bless u :)
Please make a video in English
Check the comments they are in english, perhaps a hint to reach other around the world

Are you also watching this one day before the exams?
I every video u waste atleast 2 min
Really sir u r the best teacher...
awesome explainations!!! Your tutorials are just life saver..Thanks alot sir!!!
Very helpful tutorials
Even after indexing, we have to search 1000 tuples and again it&#39;s worst case O(log2N) which is 10 tuples same as earlier. Then what&#39;s the advantage, can anyone explain?
Great way to explain..Thanks Sir
thank you sirr..<br>u are very clear with your concepts...<br>love this video<br>once again thanks..

this channel is a treasure thank you soo much sir for your efforts
Couldn&#39;t find  B/B+ tree videos sir .. :(
Sir advance indexing ka video h sir ?
The effort you are putting into your videos is absolutely precious. God bless you.
Sir, what do you do when you have multiple same value, say for 5 &quot;a&quot;. Now how do you do dense indexing?
summary starts @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-Mbn6VI1zc&amp;t=4m01s"">4:01</a>
Just came here to say Thank You to u sir!!!<br>4years ago in my 2nd year, I referred ur videos and passed...and currently working in an MNC❤️
what is the meaning of sorted main file? on what  parameter it has  to be sorted?
Jab index table se search hi karana hai to hash-table kyun na bnae uski. Binary search hi lagana hai, to index banaya hi kyun
Hindi mein samjhne ka maja hi alag h
Thanks sir g
Primary indexing -  Database is sorted.We use primary key for indexing.<br>clustered indexing - DB is sorted but we use non prime attribute for indexing.<br>Secondary indexing  - DB is NOT SORTED and we can use any of primary or non primary attribute for indexing.<br>Sparse indexing - Every record in database is entered in index table.<br>Dense indexing -  Every value(attribute that we have considered for indexing) has been entered in index table.
I can&#39;t understand your language sir please try to teach in English it would be very helpful to other students from other languages
very useful
Hello, Sanchit.<br>You said during <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-Mbn6VI1zc&amp;t=2m27s"">2:27</a> that Primary index and clustering index are different on. But they are same on they basis of Primary key, I think as below.<br><br><br>A clustering index is an index whose search key also defines the sequential order of the file. <br>*Clustering indices are also called primary indices.<br><br><br>Please clarify this ambiguity.
Oh .....nice sir ... Ur teaching..&amp;thanks sir.....clear concepts
I think there is one more type, i.e, non-cluster indexing.
Good explanation..
I accept what @ujjwal is saying .. by mistake he said but it he wanted to say that when not every records get the entry in index file for parse indexing
thanks for the diff bw sparse and dense indexing:) , but ....<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-Mbn6VI1zc&amp;t=02m07s"">02:07</a> &quot;..main file is sorted..&quot;, sorted according to what ..primary key ? non key ..?
Dens me hr record ko nahe balki hr value ko entry milte hai
B tree and b+ tree btaie
helpful
One question sir, Why you consider sparse and dense both in example 2 at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-Mbn6VI1zc&amp;t=7m27s"">7:27</a>? The sparse index works on Primary attributes and here value repeats ?
Thanks sir
Sir is it different from sql server index types<br>Cluster and non-clustered?
try  teaching in English  so that everyone could understand
Watching one day before exam in 1.5x speed😎
The instructor is stating some wrong key concepts. It is true that Primary index is defined on an ordered data file and The data file is ordered on a key field. But The key field is generally the primary key [IMP: It&#39;s not necessary , it can be any other field] of the relation.
primary indexing is not necessarily for indexing done on primary key. Correct it
Dear Sir, I didn&#39;t find the multilevel indexing video with b+ tree concept..Kindly provide the link if uploaded...
very helpful video
Sir, isn&#39;t clustered indexing based on primary key?<br>Reference: <a href=""https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-index-types.html"">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-index-types.html</a><br>You are claiming that clustered index is based on non key column - this is incorrect as per the official mysql doc.
Very good explanation
Sir confused with the definition of sparse indexing, as per my knowledge in sparse indexing &quot;index records are not created for every search key&quot; or &quot;The index record appears only for a few items in the data file&quot;.
Thankyou for giving such a clear explanation sir.
Mr. Sanchit Jain Sir its request from all students you don&#39;t cover all topics of DBMS like B tree, B+ tree, etc please make a video of all topics so we can watch your videos instead of being watching another video.
Sir Do your videos in english so that It can be understand by everyone.
bhoot zaberdast brother the example you used, fan from PAKISTAN
Sir have u uploaded the b tree videos?
sparse me har record ko kaha milti he entry apne last me sparse meto hum randomly lete he
sir index file in case of dense indexing choti kese hogi as compared to main file jubki apne ka ki sare records enter hoge usme
Sir, I was studying indexing with the help of your video lectures but, multilevel indexing lectures are missing. Sir by when you are planning to upload video lecture/s for that topic?
What is bitmap indexes
sir in the case of dense indexing we are storing every value and if we have to search any value then 1st we will see index table so for that also we have to search in index table for the value which we want to search then we will refer main table .so is it the same if we will directly refer main table in that <a href=""http://case.how/"">case.how</a> the time will save in that case...m confusing....plzz clear it.
sir can u share notes on different topics if u have. It will be really helpful if u can.
sir ,videos on ur channel are also not ordered...they are in random order.plzzz provide them <a href=""http://orderly.it/"">orderly.It</a> will helps a lot bcz now we find difficulties in finding the order.Thanks!!
Upload a video for Bitmap indices
Plz upload in english
u r the best....
sir plz upload B+ tree

Very nice discussion. I was always missing this topic due to lack of information. But now i got it with more clarity. Thanks. <br><br>Can you please upload video on decidability and undecidability and closure or language.
Very nice and deep explanation.
wow.................sir you are best better  superb.... for cse student love you sir .............
sir make more videos....<br>more student will watch because it is now exam months
Thank you sir
Thanks a lot sir, helped a lot. :D
sir can  you explan post codinate and pre codinate indexing
plz upload b tree and b+ tree video
oh sir... App indexing pay sirf 5 mint ki video bana letay...
thank you sir!!!
No Words... Even though i dont know hindi well, now i&#39;m understanding what actually this is!
u  said last sentence - &quot;har record ko entry ni di isliye ye sparx index&quot; then u said each value entry means dense and &quot;each record entry means sparx. &quot; you make confused.
sir Aap viedos upload kyun nhi kr rhe
Why in the conclusion at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-Mbn6VI1zc&amp;t=8m34s"">8:34</a> you say that sparse means &quot;when each record has got an entry in the index file&quot;? Isn&#39;t it when each record DOESN&#39;T get entry in the index file?
Although it may appear that Primary key is always used in Primary Indexing, but that is not the case. In fact, Primary indexing can be done on ANY search key. as long as the structure is primary, that is the order of the index file and record file are the same. Also clustering indices are a type of primary indexing technique. Correct me if I am wrong.
sir will you please explain steps of  query processing
sir plzz upload B tree ,B+tree videos.........

Too long and not point to point explanation
As we are using primary key, then why does sorting matters?
sir ap please compiler design ka video upload kijiye
Nice
When there are n blocks of Index file and we are applying binary search on that n blocks then the result will be the desired indexed block in which we need to again search for the block pointer of desired block of record and then we can access the record of main <a href=""http://file.so/"">file.So</a> is the formula =log(n)+log(no. of records in each block)+1?<br>Please clarify?
your lectures are extremely helpful, hope your channel gets a lot of subs and keep up the good work
Sir, In some books I found that Dense and Sparse both are the types of primary indexing?
Sir please tecah in english
Can two attributes together form a search key in Primary Indexing?
this is understandable easily but you are stretching the videos too long. This and the previous two videos are almost the same. There is nothing new in this one which wasn&#39;t in 5.4.
hello dosto
Sir IAM not finding b+ trees with example order 3 <br>It is very urgent sir please help me
When the block size and index size are equa!l then why are we applying binary search on index file ? can&#39;t we directly apply on main file which will also save the time of indexing too??
Thanks sir
Good explanation.Please do videos in English
You are repeating same thing a lot of time. 😕
Great explanation. I have been watching your DBMS videos and you teach each and every concept in great detail which is really awesome.Keep making new videos, cheers.

Sir U r amazing as usual..ur each and every video is so superb...
You are the reason ill get good marks in DBMS
Sir, why are we adding 1 instead of log68 to the total time taken to search for the record in the index file.
Thank u so much sir
Thank you Knowledge gate to provide that much knowledge free of cost...<br>your way of explanation is extremely good....Thank you so much<br><br><br>But sir i have a Query in this video<br><br>why access time is  log(n) instead of log(n)+1 as we seen in previous video
Thanks sir
As there are 45 blocks for indexed file and each block of indexed file contain 68 records of key and block pointer pair <a href=""http://record.so/"">record.So</a> when we apply binary search on 45 then we reach on desired block of indexed file i.e after 6 access we can find the desired block of indexed file but this is not the block of actual file which we are looking . We need to search the block which contain the desired record of main file so isn&#39;t the answer will be log(45)+log(68)+1? that is the search for the desired block inside the block of indexed file. Pls clarify my doubt...
Thnku sir
Is Binary Search on Blocks. Can Blocks be treated as arrays ?? Becoz then only binary search is efficient.
thank you sir , very well explained
Sanchitendra Bahubali
In main file shouldn&#39;t no. of block access required be log3000 + 1 or 12+1=13? like we are adding 1 in index file to make it 7
Super se uper
is it possible to have a variable record size

thanks sir but there is one request to upload a lecture on MULTILEVEL INDEXING
Thanks for the explanation
Hello all, <br>In various documentations that is available online, I&#39;m seeing that <br>The clustered index is automatically created on the Primary key and there is only 1 clustered index in the table, but here the definition is a bit different. <br><br>Can anyone please explain what am i missing here ?
Hello ,<br><br>Is the clustered Index on the Primary key itself ? <br><br>A clustered index determines the physical order of DATA in a table. For this reason, a table has only one clustered index(Primary key/composite key).

Why there is &gt;= instead of =  ??? teacher tried to understand that but i can&#39;t understand....

Sir May Allah bless you with the best of everything ❤️
I tried to search a document where I can find the details regarding how the clustered index is stored for the non-unique key, as you have explained, but couldn&#39;t find one. Can you please mention any website where I can find this information?
Since the sorting is based on NON-Primary ATTRIBUTE,  what will happen for NULL values of that attribute, how to search a row with NULL as value of base attribute for sorting?
what about 3 is in next block it will go in another block or not
Sir please one request to you upload the video software engineering please sir our exam nearest or 4 July 2019
My exams are just 3 hours to go and here you saved my semesters !!! ❤️

Sir please explain only cluster file organization
how would we index a file of the names of students?
english? Please?
Great sir g
Please upload B and B+ Trees video!!!
Thanks sir.. you&#39;re the exam saviour
sir what is the difference between cluster indexing and single indexing.  I think for single index data is not physically ordered on that attribute and we have to search whole table to get to those rows . ??
Sir you save asses of millions of students. Thank you for that. Please upload videos on B/B + trees, skip lists and concurrency control
Awesome
jain bhai aag hi lga di hai apne to  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,awesome  teacher  😃😃
Sir please upload video on concurrency control... I have my exam on 7th oct..
It was really helpful sir!! But I have a doubt i.e. what if the search key attribute in cluster indexing is null??
Such a great explanation thank a lotz...
Sir, as we have any table then it&#39;s sorted on the basis of a particular attribute, so in this indexing it must be necessary that the our file is sorted on the basis of that non key attribute we are using?
Please teach in English

very confused .... mix all index in all videos no such seprate explanation for each
What if all have value 1. So there will be different blocks for the main file. But you said to have only 1 record per value in the index file. Some blocks in the main file would not be determined by this process.
Sir please provide lectures on locking protocols in DBMS.
Please give some time to copy your notes, its hard to find the time where you don&#39;t cover the notes.

Thanks for the information
Actually instead of doing binary search why not do a direct hashing if the keys are however going to be unique?
really commendable job.
Why not sort the main file itself !!  I know the search attribute may not always be the same but even if we create a index file we&#39;ll have to  use only one key attribute in any case
If the main file is not even sorted then also secondary indexing applied because nonkey value or candidate key may be unsorted in the data file. Second thing is that secondary indexing applied with the primary or clustering indexing also.
U are amazing!!
Sir according to you Primary indexing is already done in secondary indexing, so while doing secondary indexing how we can take        primary key as a search key because in table there is only one primary key and we had given primary key already for Primary indexing?
Thanks sir g
East or west Sanchit sir is the best.
Yes sir please upload B and B+ tree
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoYYwKXtCC0&amp;t=13m41s"">13:41</a> if you are making notes
I think there is no benefit of secondary indexing, consider a worst case in which we have database of only unsorted files, then for fast accessing, we will make index for each file which is dense indexed.
When you are including each record in the index file then why each entry in index file point the block address,why not point to their actual address,It will save one block
Sir please can u provide lectures on Hash Based Indexing and Tree Based Indexing and B+Trees

Sir plz give videos on Multilevel Indexing plz
I don&#39;t understand one point sir.. why logn+1 here? because there are block pointers for all the SKs. so after searching , it will directly reach to the required SK value !.  😞 please answer sir.. i followed every videos made by you. and its sooooo helpful 😌
Will the amount of time taken to construct dense index file differs from sparse index file, is there any way we can quantify the difference ??
Sir please make a vedio on b-tree .
sir, pls upload multi-level index and b, b+ tree <br>Urgently pls sir
Can you please help and guide to slove these kind of questions ?<br>1. Assume that we use Extendible hashing technique in some situation and we use the hash function -  K mod 4. Assume that a bucket (one block) can accommodate 2   records.  Now insert the records with following keys in same order and give the structure of the  hashing scheme with a simple diagram-  (a) after first five insertions, and (b) after all eight insertions. Start with GD=3 and LD=2.<br>Keys to be inserted are:  16, 33, 46, 27, 11, 37, 62, 20.<br>         (Note: use the conventions taught in the class; complete working is to be given.)             <br><br><br>2. Assume that we have 10,48,000 student records to be stored in a file. Each student record has values for fields- sid (primary key), sname, college, branch, age and address. The record length is 112 Bytes and the block size on the disk is 1024 Bytes. The address of any disk block needs 12 Bytes, and the primary key of the file is of 6 Bytes long.<br>Now do the following.<br>(i) If no indexing is available, give the number of block accesses needed (worst) to retrieve a record with given key value from the file. Also give number of data blocks needed to store the data.<br>(ii) Now, design a multilevel index for the above file on the key attribute. Give – number levels, and how many index blocks are there at each level, and give the number of block accesses needed to retrieve a record with given key value from the file using the multi-level indexing structure.

Someone please give this man a nobel 😱😱 Super teacher
Best explaination.Thanks a lot.Please upload video regarding B and B+ tree.
just dont repeat same things again and again
thanks sir for excellent explanation 😃
u are repeating again and again plzzz dont repeat
After video 15, you&#39;ve made videos unnecessarily long. Please take it as a feedback and don&#39;t drag same explaination more than 2 times please.
Sir i have a question . You said that sparse indexing isnt possible with secondary indexing.! The main file isnt sorted for sure but it can have repeated value.! So while making its index we are only taking single values not the repeated one.! Thus some of the values woudnt be taken in indexing because we dont take repeate value. So there will be sparce indexing in sec. Indexing because we arent taking all the values.! Sir please try to answer this question
What if there are unsorted repeated values in main file
Hats off.... 😎
Sir,please upload B-TREE and B+ TREE
thanks sir great help to us
sir your videos are  very informative but I think explanation was repetitive
sir if block has values 1,2,3 in main file and index file too has block having 1,2,3 so it will be redundant pointing to same block in main file
nice ...one ..
Sir upload the video of B and B+ tree
sir please upload a lecture on multilevel indexing with numerical example :-)
very efficient style of teaching .looking for more videos Thanks
HI Sir: please answer one important question asked in my company exam: <br>A database is mandatory to be in 3rd normal form <br>A. true<br>b. false
thanks sir
Sir aapne serializabity puri video upload nhi kia
Sir, please upload video on b tree and b+ tree
N1
very good sir <br>this is the first time when I really know what is indexing..
good study material
sir ur videos are effective ....plzz  upload btree and b+tree video
pls upload a video on hashing. TIA
thank u sir,,it&#39;s really helpfull...
Sir shouldn&#39;t it be ( log n + 2) ?<br>Because after searching particular block in index file in log n , we need to search for key in that block in index file and from there get the particular block pointer and search desired block in main file.<br><br>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong
sir....no words for ur teaching..................just one thing i say ravindra babu rabula apke samne zero hai
plz upload a b and b+ trees
2x me ghajab mast lagta h :D
sir,plz upload a vedio on multilevel indexing
thank you Sir
sir , in urgent need for B and B+ tree. please sir.
Superb explanation! Concept completely cleared!
awesome work
who the fuck is giving dislikes isme bhi nai samajh aa rha to bhai tum fail hi ho jaon
Great to see u back again sir
thanks a lot for the video sir, hope to see b and b++ trees numericals soon

Kya without indexing unsorted main file k liye 3000 searches karne parenge yaa fir 30000 searches karne parenge? Kyuki  file toh unsorted hain ..humko kaise pata chalega k kaun se block ko access karne se sahi value mil jayega
Sir apse best koi ho hi na skta h

sir pls provide videos on B+tree
sir please upload video on B tree and B+ tree,my exams are coming,no one can explain these difficult topics better than you
sir SQL pls
thanks a lot
sir, in Navathe the block access is n/2, whereas in this video you are taking it as &#39;n&#39;.<br><br>Proof: EXAMPLE 2: Consider the file of Example 1 with r = 30,000 fixed-length records of size R = 100<br>bytes stored on a disk with block size B = 1024 bytes. The file has b = 3000 blocks, as calculated in<br>Example 1. To do a linear search on the file, we would require <b>b/2 = 3000/2 = 1500 block</b> accesses on<br>the average. Suppose that we construct a secondary index on a nonordering key field of the file that is<br>V = 9 bytes long. As in Example 1, a block pointer is P = 6 bytes long, so each index entry is Ri = (9 +<br>6) = 15 bytes, and the blocking factor for the index is bfri = (B/Ri) = (1024/15) = 68 entries per block.<br>In a dense secondary index such as this, the total number of index entries ri is equal to the number of<br>records in the data file, which is 30,000. The number of blocks needed for the index is hence bi =<br>(ri/bfri) = (30,000/68) = 442 blocks.
cluster index created when<br>a. primary key declared and ordered<br>b no key ordered<br>c. foreign key ordered<br>d. there is no key no ordered<br>my answer is B is that true or not given your answer please sir............
thanks sir ji for great explaination😆
Sir bahut maja aa raha hai!!...padhaate raho!
Great explaination sir
no one can explain like you ever....you are exception,mind blowing.thanks a lot sir<br> RELATIONAL ALGEBRA  /SQL PLZ
SQL ko describe kijiye sir
thank you sir , I like the way of your teaching . Its very useful for me.<br>sir please make a video on b,b+ trees .
Sir, If you say you are not implementing indexing and this can be a case of secondary indexing then you don&#39;t know in which block data/record exists. So here worst case scenario O(n) then total access required w/o indexing will be 30k not 3k. But, anyway we got it.
Thanks Sanchit. Please upload videos on Caching.
thank you sir!
Thank you so much for clearing the concept. I missed al this in my classes

I really appreciate your help sir. Thank you.
sachin tanduklar vs air conditioner 😂😂
sachin tendulkar vs airconditioner...... who will win? xdxd
😊😊
Thanks sir g
Thank u so much
comparison between the air conditioner and Sachin Tendulkar 😂😂😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
B+ and multilevel indexing questions??where&#39;s the videos??
Lesson : be like secondary not like primary
hahah he cracked me when he said kon better he sachin tendulkar ya air conditioner
without secondary indexing why is the number of block access 1539 and not 20000? What is the point of making blocks when we are not sure about the location?
clear and precise video, thankyou sir
Sir,the video lectures of multilevel  indexing and b tree is not available on your video series of dbms
Sachin Tendulkar vs Air Conditioner!!
agar galat hain to kiya kyun......ek aur video dal dete
One question, in the sorted case if indexing is not involved then why we are not applying the log base 2 of n formula directly to the 20,000 records because if indexing is not involved blocks are insignificant/not present. Please correct me if i am wrong somewhere.
Great Tutorials sir.<br>Question 1: How can we sort the main file on a column?<br>Question 2: How does the index file change when a record is inserted or deleted?
Best 🔥🔥
The ideal way of teaching. The rhythm , pitch, speed , modulation and content  everything is perfect. watched many videos on you tube  but your way of teaching is really very good. A small suggestion for your channel pls arrange all the uploaded video in chronological order  subject wise as per the syllabus . Secondly Please upload videos of Multilevel indexing that is B tree and Bplus tree. I am very much impressed and will try to take your live class if possible. Thanks Sir
Sachin: Who are you?<br>Air Conditioner: You are me but have different applications
There is no video of...B Nd B+ Tree
Firstly thanks for all your videos.<br>Sir please opt for only those adds which are somewhat relevant to students.When watching your videos I am seeing irrelevant and annoying ads and also ads are showing very frequently (same ad 2 times in a video).
sachin vs air conditioner 😜
Sir pls upload video on multi level indexing and b and b+ tree.... Pls pls
But Sir, secondary indexing can be used on both sorted and unsorted files(as you mentioned in previous videos- it does not matter if the anchor is a key attribute or not) but primary indexing can only be used on sorted files so overall secondary indexing is better, right?
Sir, will you making videos for multi level indexing b trees and b+ trees if yes then when
Sir please upload videos on B and B+ tree.
When he named sachin, I thought he was going to compare him with sehwag but Air Conditioner😂😂😂
I fucking wish I knew hindi. fuck me and fuck my data structure prof
sir your videos are amazing... waiting for multilevel indexing,b and b+ trees videos
Sir please do B and B+ tree
Sachin vs AC ? lmao .
Sir plz upload the videos on B and B+ trees.
Sir please make a video on multilevel indexes . I have exam tomorrow :&#39;(

Sir, please make the video on, How to find the number of recoverable schedules.
English title, speak in english man. <br>You don&#39;t speak in english? change the title to the same language.
When we take lower bound of record in a block .,sir wo extra part kahan place kiya jata hai ..as in numerical I dnt see u giving that extra part any space anywhere ..plz anybdy reply
sir please explain in English
Super sir..
good explaination sir ji😃
gazab sir .....
Sir, for the additional block search constant +1, why are we not considering the binary searches within the block? For primary indexing, each index block has 102 entries. Suppose, we want to access a record whose entry is the 102nd entry of a block, after Logn search for the blocks, again we require Log102=7 searches within the block. Now we get the base address of 102nd entry. This base address brings me to the particular block in main file. Now, suppose the record I want to search is actually the 13th record of this block. So again we apply Log13=4 searches to find the particular record. So it would be +7+1+4=12 searches in worst case. Why are we not considering those searches? Or is it just a time complexity calculation where search within a block is constant? <br><br>R u talking about time complexity
For unsorted main file access, even though there are 1539 blocks, we have to search all records within a block, so total access would be equal to no.of records, i.e. 20000
at 7.29 small mistake it sud be no. of blocks=20000/102
at 7.29 small mistake it sud be no. of blocks=20000/102
Beautifully explained!

Sir UGC NET December 2021 June 2022 Merged Cycle jiska exam October 2022 me conduct karaya gaya tha usme DBMS se 5 questions the same dataset pe jisme 3 tables die gae the. Uske options pe δ operator ka use kia gaya tha, uska use na pata hone ki wajeh se mai wo questions attempt nahi kar paya tha or na hi mujhe kahi δ operaor ke bare me kahi bhi janne ko ya padhne ko mila, bahut khojne ke bad bhi kuch pata nahi chala or apne bhi kahi iska zikr nahi kia hai. Kya ye paper me printing mistake thi ya δ operator  bhi exist karta hai relational algebra me? agar ha, to uska use kya hai? Eagerly awaiting your response sir

sir QNO.3 me &#39;nor&#39; nahi hain aapne &#39;or&#39; likha huwaa hain so according to question ans is  PROJECTION FROM TABLE DEPOSITER  CUS_NAME - PROJECTION FROM TABLE BORROWER CUS_NAME    hoonaa chiyena sir .... i confusion in this part sir
Thanks sir🙏🔥
Sir, is union and intersection same as OR and AND?
Thanks
Gobar milega really cracked me 😂😂
sir in Q3 can we do set difference(Costumer - account -borrower) instead of doing union of acc and borrower and then doing set difference
Thank you very much sir
Gobber milega  ... wo to hmare gao me milega 🤪 .... you are very funny but so interesting about learning and teaching ... thank a lot respected sir
If the &quot; set difference&quot; of two relations will always give the fisrt relation. Then y should we use &quot; set difference&quot;<br>Qno.6 fr example we can just take branch_name of Account table.

REAlly got a great help from you sir!!!!!!!!!-<br>---------------T-HAM-NK-======================
👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻
Sir we can use join instead of Cartesian product
Thanks sir g
Sir infinity times thanks to you..only and only because of you I can write SQL query with clear concepts..SQL is not a topic which should be cramped so sir from bottom of my heart Really Thank you so muchhh🙇🙇🙇🙇
sir can be do nested query

Thank u so much sir

Best lectures on YouTube
sir you are great thank you so much but please cover the natural join topic sir
natural joins?
Sir please upload videos 8.0 natural joins
sir 2 saal ka samay dediya aapko but abtak upload nahi kiya aapne joins ka
where is the video for natural join using relational algebra immediately after cartesian product . You are directly  moving to SQl . If you have to put the videos on youtube please insert all or nothing. It really frustrates us when we are concentrating and learning and you suddenly skip to another portion . If that video is a paid one please provide link for that so we can maintain our  learning in a sequential  manner . This same happened in ER Diagram section where you told next ill teach strong and weak entity set but that  video is skipped and you have moved somewhere else. Dont play with someone while learning either post complete videos for free or make it a complete subscription. I like the way you teach so that i can and others understand that is the reason i have this strong point for you. Please donot ignore this, this might affect other learners too. Its been a long time now  its 2020 now and videos are of sept 2018.
natural join
joins kaha hai Sir Relational algebra ke
natural joins?
Sir thanks for your videos!<br>sir please also make videos for QUERY OPTIMIZATION covering advance level examples.<br>here the queries you have generated are not optimized and can be optimized using natural join and also doing query operations in particular order.
Please make rest videos asap :)
if the Cartesian product is a binary operator, then how can we take three tables at once in the second example?
This is discontinued right?
Sir relational calculus ki bhi video upload kariye pls...

Thank you so much sir for making us understand the dbms&#39; all important concepts in an easier way. Really like the way you teach and explain the things by co-relating with some real world scenarios. I haven&#39;t seen anyone teaching with such an appreciable n cool approach and that too, from the very scratch. Just to add, I watched your videos and found some important topics missing (Joins and B,B+ trees in file structure). Thanks a lot for making the students like us gain the knowledge which really help.

Sir while u explain everything well some of the topics like tuple and domain calculus and inner join in relational algebra are missing also how to converter the model to a relational model. Plz add these sir it would help us a lot
sir lekin borrower table me dipositor vale customer to nahi hoge to fir vo to chut jayenge to usake liye kya kare ??
I was so confused about this topic, and after watching this video, my all doubts got cleared. !!!
If Table1 has m rows and Table 2 has n rows, will the cartesian product of these two have m + n rows or m x n rows?
Thanks sir g
ya aaj samaj me aaya......thanku sir
But sir branch name are common for some account no
Thank you sir... i understood it in one go
Sir can we write like,.          <br> Select cname from customer where branch_name IN (Select branch_name from branch where branch_name=&#39;ND&#39;)
Correction : Cartesian product will give m*n tuples
thank you,sir

I&#39;m glad I spent 12 mins of my life watching this video 🤩, what a great explanation given about the topic 🙏
Sir can u please upload complete video series of Relational Algebra with (Rename,join operators) and the practice problems related to them
Thanks sir g
i need 4xxxxxxx
Thank u so much sir 😇🙏🙏🙏
thanku sir
but that is also useless schema if there is no same attribute value in between two tables, is it right?
But that is not data loss....simply they are not setisfying the condition....so not selected in result
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHPHkqHAu9Y&amp;t=3m47s"">3:47</a> that duster looks like he is pissed off with his day job ...
Sir why your duster is defying gravity why it is not falling from the board why it is sticking on the board🥺
Thankyou you sir..🙏🙏
Only one doubt:data loss will also occur in cartesian product if we are specifying the two attributes to be common..or will it no..there also it will select only those tuples which are common..anyways appreciate your efforts and the correctness of your lectures
Love u sir , u save me from getting bad marks , a I do last day study 🤘🤘🤘
hi can u please explain it in english so that everyone can understand. thank you.
Jo last point bola gya h data loss ka.<br>University exm m table diya rhta h only col name k sath uska data nhi diya rhta to tb identity nhi kr skte common attribute ka data match ho rha ya nhi to tb natural join use kr skte h ya nhi ?
isinner join and natural  is same
Very very useful video sir lekin 1 doubt clear Nahi ho Raha hai DUSTER ko aap BOARD par kaise chipkate ho
thanks,sir
Sir please upload videos on Demand paging, Page replacement and thrashing in Operationg system.

Sir can we say natural join remove duplicate values?
ډير ښه۔ <br>sir im form peshawar afghani but love like indian teachers .. extrema  hate indian film acter...

it&#39;s very diffucult for me to understand you sir , why you talk like having something in your mouth ? you don&#39;t speak english clearly and it&#39;s difficult to understand i don&#39;t know how americans can understand you
kuch n smjh aya bhai is bar to
R1 join R2 using B <br>A  B  R1C  R2C  D   5 COLUMN SHOULD BE THERE.
Self referential note: join operator starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJv614Y0lFA&amp;t=3m37s"">3:37</a>
Sir in join also if using keyword is used then also the attribute name must be same in both tables then how is it better than natural join ?? In natural join also we have a need of same name of attribute na then how is it different in join
thanks sir
When doing join using B.... Can we write B column only single time?... U have written it two times R1.b and R2.b
Sir y did u choose loan and borrower although the name is in Cutomer relation?
Very toughly explained, can&#39;t understand anything
In this question is there any problem using Natural join🤔<br><br><br>What happen if I use natural join
Paham paham..bafeto sabarang🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
let me say
You deserve respect man!<br>Great effort.
Nice
It&#39;s late..<br>Anyways, Thank you Sir :v
Sir if possible please make videos on virtualisation, there are not many videos available for it

Loan is a powerfull operator😁 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z996Uv9MNaQ&amp;t=02m53s"">02:53</a><br><br>JK. Awesome series. But why you made most videos private :(
select c_name from loan,borrower where amount &gt;1000 and loan.l_no =borrower.l_no ; whats the difference &quot; we are using on instead of where , this is the only difference i found?
Awesome series thank you so muchh
on likhne ki kya jarrorat hai sir...yehi same functionality toh cartesian se bhi milti hai na??? cartesian mein bhi toh hum L.L_no =B.L_no. kar sakte hai...aur koi dusra naam ho toh use equate karva sakte hai????
thanku sir
&#39;ON&#39; can be used without Join queries?

Transaction is a set of instructions that do some logical work as far as client concerned transactions must be executed  in atomic Nature.either the work is executed or not executed.If there&#39;s a failure occurs we must roll back

Never thought that DBMS would be such a wonderful subject, all credits goes to you sir. No amount of words can justify your effort sir.<br>Your videos may have very less views but trust me sir your videos are impacting a million of lives, somewhere some developer must be designing a database after going through your video which will be having records of millions of users.😇😍👌
is int i=5; atomic? or are the fetch,decode,execute cycles atomic? I mean, is it possible for int i=5 to get blocked in between due to some other process?
Brilliant👍 sir

How can you be so perfect man.
Transaction : A set of instructions which performs a logical unit of work, that must be always atomic in nature.

Thank you so much sir
ENGLISH SIR  I am not indian
I hope this comments section is not only for praises but also for some words of suggestion, I&#39;m a student and I feel that you are doing really a good job but the pace at which the videos go is a tad slow you could have completed acid properties within 5min so please be more precise and I hope one example is enough and no need of repeating it again, btw thanks a lot you make some wonderful content.Cheers!!
Was explained well .I could even translate it in English and write my answer on the ACID properties.
Pls explain in English .Every one don&#39;t know Hindi write
Thanks sir

Awesome Explanation😲
anyone from mam tayyaba&#39;s link?
sir please provide notes
Why do we need to rollback changes in local buffer ? if the changes are only present in Local buffer we can discard the buffer altogether.
In the case of failure in partially committed state, why are we doing rollback as we performed R/W operations on the copy of the original database. If any failure occurs, just discard that copy. Isn&#39;t it?
Finally,  got to know how to implement these topics. Explained really well.
🥰❤❤

Agar partially committed se permanent storage me failure hua to kya hoga Jaise agar a,b,c store karna hai db me aur Sirf a and b hi store hua db me fir failure hogaya fir to db inconsistant hoga na
you are a hero sir !!! sir aap dhaakad ho<br>only bcoz of u mre university exams acche hote h

Thank you sir !<br>plz sir teach to my mam ,we are the first student whom she teaching first time in her life so she is not teaching not as well as you where teaching to us...
Teach in inglish
sir if r/w operations occure in buffer then if there is failure , transaction move to failed state....then why is the need of roll back, since original data base has not been used till partial commited state
sir aap bhagwan hain.
Sir you are GREAT!!
Sir, DS and Algo ke vidoes bhi banaiye... Aap Bahut hi acha explain krte hai, Saare Doubts Khatam ho jate hai!! Thankyou sir for providing us these videos!!

Sir, ...where are the videos for B and B+ trees?
Sir please upload videos on computer organization before gate
Ticket to cut chuka h :)
too much ads:(
Kon hai vo log jo iss video ko bh dislike karte hai doob marna chaiye unhe.
As you mentioned if we are working on buffer/replica of database then why do we need to rollback the transaction we can simply discard that copy.
You saved me sir.. it seemed so difficult before this video.
When we are not performing transaction on our DB as mentioned that we use buffer then why we need to role back if failure occurs??
Great video, I just have one question which is<br>if State goes to failure directly after active, than what things will be roll back? I mean we don&#39;t have any previous instruction right. so what will happen?
Sir please upload vedio deadlock in dbms
Sir your way of teaching is extremely great!!....
Thanku sir
Thank u sir
Perfect
Firstly I would like to thank you for the concept sir..<br>But I have a question to ask that is till partially committed state, all the operation is done on local buffer and if something went wrong then why to rollback. Can&#39;t we simply discard that as it is just a photocopy.
sir plz upload the video of query language
thank you sir
if firstly database is conistence then why we perform trasaction on it to make it consistence sir????<br>as u told us that in aborted state after and before applied transcation the consistency will be same!!!!! then why ??
Thnku sir G Shoaib Arshad
Really the teacher i had ever seen!!! <br>the best part about your videos is your energy level in each and every video.
Why are the videos uploaded again its already there in dbms-1 playlist? It confuses me what to watch plz clarify?

Finally fell in love with DBMS.  It&#39;s just because of you sir...
i am getting addicted to your way of teaching ! you are becoming my hero sir !!!!! thanks a lot ... keep uploading videos..
🙏thanks a lot sir!<br>The photocopy example to explain partially committed st was really great! Neither in college nor by reading book i could understand what the real use of that state meant. Your video is amazing as usual!!!!

Sir please SQL ka videos upload Kar dijiye
Good teaching sir<br>sir plz concurrency control protocol par bhi video bnaiye
💞💞💞💞
In acid properties of transaction, isolation is there, which says that output of transaction is same if it is running alone or if multiple transactions are running. Then if multiple transactions are running, database consistency shouldn&#39;t be a problem.
Ur videos are vry gud sir..
sir you are great hero!!! still I never found any teacher like you in my school and college ..............thank you so much sir

Okay Sir . Will submit my answer sheet in the end 🫡😁😅
sir you are the best  teacher on this planet and this universe you arer god of enginerring study
Whenever I watch lectures on some other YouTube channel, it makes me mentally tired within an hour since I have to comprehend the core concept of the video myself as they usually provide only shallow explanation. But your simplistic examples of these concepts make me feel that I am learning effortlessly and hence, I can watch your videos for hours. <br>thank you so much sir.
One doubt : even if T2 is committing after t1 still how will T2 come to know that t1 has rollbacked or the answer T2 copied was wrong ? As there is logical isolation then t1 rollbacked will not tell T2 to rollback as well so how is T2 committing after t1 has committed , a solution to dirty read problem?
wow fully understood
amazing explaination  sir
best explaintion of dirty problem ever no one can teach as you
wow sir you gave a golden rule for cheating 😀😀🤣
op sir ,sir teach me how to cheat in exam thank you for the information
poor english
Thank you so so much sir
Sir app kho jate ho concept k andar t2 bhaisahb lots of respect to you sir <br>Deeply from my heart🙏🙏🤩
example bdiya tha😂😂
Kuch fayeda nahi hai sir, Ram chupa ke likhta hai aur submit bhi karr diya.
thankyou so much sir, for creating this content
Very nice example sir
The example used is in itself capable of explaining the whole concept. God level teaching, I must say.
💯💯👍
BEST 🔥
so sir in that case (solution of dirty ready) . The waiting and respose time will be increase for T2 transaction . if someone know please reply.
Example in the beginning sums up the whole dirty read problem....
friend :- bhai kya padh raha hai ?? <br> innocent me : cheating karna
Firsty thanku so much sir ,I m student of electrical engineering but last 4 month I has followe ur COMPUTER SCIENCE (gate video) for  <a href=""http://m.tech/"">M.tech</a> . I covered all  most 5 subject.  After watching this video Now I can say I clear gate exam 2022.  And I also need ur blessings. Ur way of teaching it&#39;s wonderful sir . 🙏
best explaination , must watch for everyone having DBMS in his/her semester   highly recommended
Best explanation how to cheat copy 😇😇😇 but good explanation
best explanation sir proud of you sir
Thanks sir g
Very good experience
❤️❤️
cheating krna adhikaar tha uska
Amazing
Sir you are God of computer Science 🙏🙏
saanp
It mean traction in happening on same device at same time as you  mentioned local buffer RAM
Thanks for the cheating example!
your examples ✌✌✌✌👌👌👌👌👌👌
No of likes = No of views . Please do like his videos. We tend to forget because he doesn&#39;t waste time reminding us to like share subscribe.
Wow! Just amazing!
sir why there is a need for a txn2 to take value from txn1 , txn 2 can take its own value to read
Thank you sir.
I will follow this in exam😁😎
any Shyam watching these lectures&quot;? dont feel guilty,
Ram shyam ka example bht badiya tha
Sir <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPOfYF0Ya6E&amp;t=8m21s"">8:21</a> Shyam becomes Ram and Ram becomes Shyam :D
Sir you are too good your explanation way is very nice

What an explanation sir!! couldn&#39;t resist me from appreciating and thanking you.....
Thank you so much sir. Story of Ram and Shyam cleared every doubt :)

best way to make uderstand the problem.thanks
What a great example sir...your analogy is always the best 👌👌
Sir T2 ne commit kr dia to database me  value change ho jaegi n?
Life saver
This example has brought smile on everyone face it give us a cheerish moment in such stressful situation
Amazing sir ji
Superb explanation sir. Hats off.
Sir pls do explain about the incorrect summary problem
Thanks sir
sir u rocks
i love the way u teach

Thnku so much sir , aapke  vedios  ne bhut help ki hi
simple and best...😊😊😊
hi sir,<br>thanks for ur wonderful videos.... i hv one question regarding transaction , what is difference between ANSI/ISO transaction model and normal transaction...n transaction log.....pls explain
How will transaction t2 know that a failure occurred in t1?
Example mast tha sir
how come it holds the isolation property of transaction when one transaction is reading values from another transaction?
watched almost 5-6 videos but found here the best explanation for dirty read problem..<br>Thanks sir!
No one like u sir....thank u so much
Thank you Sir for clearing our concept on Dirty read problem by giving a real life example, I&#39;m never gonna forget this logic.This is probably the best explained video on youtube.
What an amazing analogy Sir. Hats off!! :)
Hi Sanchit,<br>1st of all thank u so much for your effort. Its been truly helpful. One question though, is it always true that T2 will read the value of A from local buffer (which has been altered by T1 in your example) ?  Asking this because, uncommitted values r not visible to other sessions, right? Can u plz clarify?<br><br>Thanks again for ur help.
Hats off to u ...gr8 explanation..i hope i won&#39;t never forget this topic in future
Sir, plz provide blueprint for Computer Network
Great explanation bro.

Ghr m hau hota h😂
sir as u said T1 read the value from DB and deleted it in buffer but T2 is also a type of independent transaction because it holds isolation property so why t2 can&#39;t read the data from actual db.<br>in my point of view the transaction which initiate first can only able to read from DB and rest will be read from DB
Thank you so much sir,  great explanation with stories,    love from J&amp;K

Phantom Read: A transaction re-executes a query returning a set of rows that satisfies a search condition and finds that another committed transaction has inserted additional rows that satisfy the condition.<br>Source: <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/server.920/a96524/c21cnsis.htm"">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/server.920/a96524/c21cnsis.htm</a>

I am  very thankful to you sir <br>Till now I haven&#39;t meet any teacher like you . <br>You are the 👍Best
Sir <br>Ek doubt h.. <br>Agr local buffer me X nahi milega to kya T2 database se read krne nahi jayga?
If t2 while reading for the second time .. it doesn&#39;t find variable X in local buffer won&#39;t it find the value in actual database ? ..problem kaha se hui usme ? ... T1 ne to commit nahi kiya tha na ... T2 should still be able to read the values from database
skipping this video after watching the previous one!!!

very helpful sir, thanks!
example for this<br>Imagine you and your friend are sharing a digital notepad. You both decide to update the same line in the notepad at the same time. You write “Hello” and your friend writes “Hi”. You both save your changes almost simultaneously. However, your friend’s save happens a split second after yours. So, when you open the notepad again, you see “Hi” instead of “Hello”. Your update was lost because it was overwritten by your friend’s update. This is similar to the lost update problem in a Database Management System (DBMS).<br><br>In DBMS terms, a lost update problem occurs when two transactions (like you and your friend in the example) are updating the same record at the same time. The first transaction (you) updates a record (writes “Hello”) and the second transaction (your friend) updates the same record again (writes “Hi”), which nullifies the update of the first transaction (your “Hello” is lost). This is why it’s called the lost update problem.

best best best explanation guruji
aren&#39;t transactions have different buffer where they store their own written value and update the value of database after commit ?
Dhanyawad Sir Ji
thank you so much Sir
😊😊😊
Please upload video 6.10
Thanks sir g
Exams approaching. 6.10 still missing. Singh is ki... 😂
**correction <br>Blind write is a write when a transition write a value without reading it
May be this can be a example/story of  this conflict :<br><br>Assume that you love to cook food. <br>Your mother was cooking something and she added some salt to the food according to taste and took the next work out of kitchen. Now you come to the kitchen and thought that you have to add some salt to it and you added more salt to the food. And then when you and your family are eating that food it was too much salty and now all the fault is on your mother as she don&#39;t know what she was committing in this place serving . All this problem is because of you as you added more salt without reading the value of salt added by your mother but you sit silently and enjoy the salty food 😋😋
Baccha maggie rakhkar cartoon dekhne laga ki koi aa kar uski jagah gulabjamun rakh gaya..
ye to pura 3 idiots ka chamatkar&gt;&gt;balatkar wala kahani hai....
Dear sir where is 6.10 lecture kindly share the link plzzz
Gud  way
Blind write is  kisi bhi transaction ko write kare bina use read kare i think 🙄🙄
Sir please make videos on Computer Networks and Compiler design.
I just wanted to know what dirty read is... but I came all the way here only to know the entire story of that child!😂😂 Likes , if you too reached here the same way!😂
love it sir!!!!!!!
कभी कभी लगता है sir आप ही भगवान है ।
ia baar bache ne bhoot ko confuse kar diya
biggest mystery of the era...PART 6.10...what topic was it based on and why it never got uploaded...mystery still continues...:)
What if T1 rollsback before commit?
Sir, kya T1 ka local buffer aur T2 ka local buffer same hoga? Agar haan to kyu? Agar dono k local buffer alag hote to lost update problem nahi hoti..
Thanks sir
Sir, we want hear stories too😋😅😂
Sir please upload 6.10
Sir B aur B+ tree ka videos banayena
Jab tak aap kahani nahin sunayenge apun idharich hai.........
sir in this video i get confused jab t1 ne write kar dia  a=11 or t2 ne same value ko 50 write kar dia then committee b kar dia iska matlab DB mae value 50 store ho gayi then again t1 A ki value ko committee karega tab vo 11 karega ya 50 karega. mere khyal se usye 11 karna chaiye kyoki t1 ab DB read nahi kar rha vo 11 committee kar rha hai then DB mae to 11 store hona chaiye. Plz assist me.
Sir i am very cheer by read your all videos mujhe aesa lag rha hai mai regular college mae beth kar sidhe class le rha hu
Blind Write
hello sir why there is not  6.10 ? btw thnak you for awesome dbms series...
Sir,<br>Is there is any way to contact with you..<br>I want to join your full course lecture
Sir, what happens if T1 is committed just after T2 writes on the data buffer and then T2 commits. Will the effect be same ?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7RUUgHS3ck&amp;t=1m46s"">1:46</a> write kare bina read kiye ?
are lost update waali ka 2x option q ni aara
sir ismei aap yeh bta sakte thy ki ek baar bachcha maggi mei masala daalkr gya aur fir bhoot ne ek baar aur masala daal dia...
if Lost update problem is write write conflict then what about premature writes???
Thanks sir

Thank You Got Some Good Help♥️♥️♥️
Thanku so much sir ji
Sir, I have a doubt<br>As the processor executes only one instruction, then the time taken by Transaction T1 and T2 in the case of both serial schedule and non-serieal schedule should be same as the InstructionCount(T1) + InstructionCount(T2) is constant for both the schedules. If this is the case then what is the benefit of non-serial schedule over serial schedule

These teachers from India most of them are very useless 😨😨 reason being This is Youtube whatever you posted here is for everyone on the global so why dont you teachers use English language instead of indian Language so that everyone on the world can benefit from whatever your teaching..... i&#39;m very anoyed when i see teachers explaining lesson their language so if these videos your posting is only meant for Indian students create your own youtube where you post your language ...... Stop such nonesense.

sir please upload videos on relation algebra a and B+ trees and other left topics of rdbms , it will be really helpful.
sir if both transaction  will write variable a this will non conflict bcoz final value is same  a=3 in t1 a=a+5 and t2 a=a+10 now if t1 w(a) means a=8 now t2 w(a) means a=8+10=18 and vice versa ans is 18 so final value is same it&#39;s example of non conflict

isn&#39;t this a duplicate video of 8.9 again? same things are discussed in both videos, about write write conflict
sir it is already covered in 8.9 lost upadate
sir aap kabhi hindi me padhate ho kabhi english me , but explanation is clear in both languages😃
🖕 All thanks to the above mentioned name his intelligent skills provided me complete access to my man&#39;s account 💯
Thank you sir
very well explained sir ...thank you
lost update and blind write are different
Sir plzzz change the order  of videos in the playlist. Place Phantom Read problem before this video.
Q: Respected Sir, jaisa ki aapne kha, transaction ko commit krne ke baad, transaction ki value permanently database mai store ho, jati hai.<br>Lakin apne dirty read  problem mai bhi to T2 transaction ke  R(a) ko commit kiya tha, to phir uski value ko database mai permanently store kyu nahi kiya?<br>Pls rply!
So there wont be any updation,after T1 is commited, because its a problem faced by dbms? Am i Right?
Sir can we get a video on lock based protocol?
sir please continue with only in english because we dont understand hindi...
good
Hindi me banavo video sir
And we will do what?....fail this course
Really hats of u sir.... Nyz teaching style.... Try to make the lecture in english.......
sir please make video on lost delete anomaly
bohot bohot dhanyawad!
Sir. Lovely way of explaining. You explain such a complicated things in easiest way.
Sir please upload video on Thomas write rule...
Bhai Tumne dil khush krdiya♥️Hats off to you🤙🏻
I am indebted to you sir :...)
Sir,can you upload the video regarding graph based protocol.....
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7N-TdqNVRc&amp;t=3m50s"">3:50</a> you said all ACID property satisfied but still inconsistent state ? isn&#39;t consistency itself a ACID property and if database is in inconsistent state how the C in ACID property satisfied !
Is the local buffer common to a single schedule or is it common to all of the schedules?
Great work <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Sir"">#Sir</a>
Level Hai Boss
Sir, Won&#39;t the transaction T1 publish value 11 into the database and overwrite T2&#39;s value since according to it, it has  computed the value 11
sir plzz upload video on file structure...
sir plz upload a lecture on ER diagram , and thnk u so much
Sir,Why don,t you distinguish between WW and Lost update ?
sir,very nice videos ....sir where is phantom read pbm????? u said in the video
Sir, Won&#39;t the transaction T1 publish value 11 into the database and overwrite T2&#39;s value since according to it, it has  computed the value 11
sir what is incorrect summary problem ????<br>any video on that ????
sir ,upload more video on so.pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
great explanation and thank you sir
Prabhu!!!
Great job sir... Efficient n effective lecture...  Thnku sir.. Waitingg for next videos 😃

Stop scrolling and focus on video
Sir,Me and my mates binge watched your videos  together one night before exam , and we rocked it for sure. THANKYOUSM
If write is above and then read. It will be a clash??
Excellent sirji
Conclusion of video in Just one word amazing
Speak in English please
This is the best video to practice questions on this topic
Thank You Sir very much!!
great application of topological sort
ONE VIDEO IT TAKES TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIS TEACHING
Thanks sir g
Best dbms lecture n awesome teaching methodology. 😇
Don&#39;t know about others but I get to learn a lot of new things from you.
Thank you sir.
Why English title if the video is not in English ...

i just want to give you a BIG Thank you :) :)
sir can u add the same video in English please
sir live video banan na doubt clear korte parbo
Sir add bahut aa rahe hai. Ek video me 7-10 add aa rahe hai.
Excellent explanation sir
Pls make videos on deadlock systems
Your tutorial is awosome. I Like that ;-)
The reason why i would don&#39;t like your videos is your teaching speed.Please do reduce your speed. At times its really frustrating.
Sir from bottom of my heart i want to say thank you..your video are really helpful for me in DBMS..Thank you sir..😊
Cycle nahi Banega sir<br>Shayad sir se dekhne me mistake ho gayi hogi<br>W(x) Ko R(X)<br>Padh Liya hoga
Superb sir salute you!! Concept is clear now 👍👍
cycle kaise bani
Ap agar mere teacher hote toh main university topper aur gate topper banta....<br>But later is always better than never.. Many many thanks sir...
Sir kash ki AAP algorithm design and analysis bi padate.but for this vedio you r superb sir
R(y)  me kyu cycle nahi bani and w(x) me cycle bani please will give the answer sir?
Very nice sir 👍
Where is cycle.... Not a complete cycle... Half cycle is there... T1 and t3... ....
Thanks sir. Ur teaching method is very good
cycle kaha bani???
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkROSmKbVFQ&amp;t=9m22s"">9:22</a> par T3 se T2 kaise hua?

Sir i think we can do this in o(n) with toplogical sort
topological sort ki khushboo aa rhi hai

great application of topological sort
Thanks sir g
Apply the concept of serializability, prove that the given schedule <br>S is conflict serializable. S: R2(A); R3(C); W3(A); W2(A); <br>W2(B); W3(C); R1(A); R1(B); W1(A); W1(B
use topological sort :-)    O(n)
why not t2---&gt;t4????(W(y)--&gt;R(y))
I must mention that the last question is wrong, you don&#39;t consider the commit at all for checking conflict serializability. I found out the hard way by getting 0 in this type of question in an exam
O(v+e) coast .....not n2    using dfs.
Sir, how to check conflict serializability  with checkpoints given<br>like this interleaved concurrent schedule<br>Start(T1); R1(A) ; Start(T2); R2(A) ; CKPT(1); W1(A) ; START(T3); R2(B);<br>W3(A) W2(B); R1(B); R3(B); COMMIT(T1); W1(B) ; CKPT(2); W3(B);<br>COMMIT(T2);
Sir please check for any correction in the last example
Thanks a lot.
Sir ek doubt tha, t2-&gt;t3 aur agar t2-&gt; t1 bhi lele<br>But agar order (t2-&gt;t3-&gt;t1-&gt;t4) and order (t1-&gt;t2-&gt;t3-&gt;t4) mein end value of X vary karege na database mein..... toh yeh kaise possible hai ki 2 order exist karte hai n unke end result different hai?
Sir firstly thanks for your videos<br>In this videos you told us that when we commit a operation then we dont check it for further transactions when checking conflict serializability but it is WRONG.<br>Also I have refer many sites before writing  this comment.<br>Actually commit has nothing to do when checking for conflict serializability and its precedence graph will same as if not having any commits in it.<br>We will check commit only for recoverabilty,strict schedules.
Sir I think in case of finding view and conflict serializability , we don&#39;t consider COMMIT at all , it will result  same graph with or without COMMIT.<br>If in case of finding recoverability or strict or cascadeless , we must consider COMMIT .<br>Sir kindly, Correct me if I&#39;m wrong.
Sir last example me choti si mistake Hui hai t2-t1 hona chahiye
My Answer(comment)is also the same ....t2-&gt;t1
I like your videos alot sir. I am learning very much new things. Everything runs fine, but please can you put hardly 1-2 ads so that concentration doesn&#39;t disturb. Please do if possible sir. Thank you.<br>Keep it up sir.
thnk you very much
there should be an edge from T2 -&gt; T1
t2  se t1 bhi to conflict hoega?
why is R(X) T is checked for all the x values but the same is not done for R(Y)
Please make a video on relational calculus
It also contain edge between t2-t1 then......is der any effect on  cost or it remain same?
Thanks sir ji😆
Sir what about T2-T1?????
commit wala question, apka english wala playlist mein ap khud hi t2-&gt;t1 dye the...aur yaha nhi hoga bol dya....kindly clearfy it Sir
I don&#39;t know if this question makes sense, but what if instead of commit (c), there is abort (a) in one or more transactions ? What would be the approach to that ?
Sir can u upload more more videos on Gate year previous paper for more practice for every topic of each subject...<br>Sir U are really so good .
cycle detection can be done in O(v+e) v=vertices,e=edges number
Sir is question me t2 se t1 k bich conflict hoga
There should be an edge from T2 --&gt; T1 in example 2
@Sanchit Jain: T2 -&gt; T1 will also have a Read-Write Conflict. Though it wont affect the conflict serializability in any way.
TO T2 ka r(x) T1 K W(X) KO derive karega<br>might be plz clr sir
sir in S2 ,  T2(  r(x))-----&gt; T1(W(X) K LIYE COMMIT NHI HO RHA H
a small blunder in last example. missed an edge from t2-&gt;t1
Cycle detection is possible in O(n) time using a dfs on a directed graph
what about T2 to T4 as w(y) in T2and R(y) in T4
what about T2-T1
T2--T1 bhi hona chahiye
Best Expaination
Please if possible upload next lectures on locking protocols
Sir please , relational algebra in dbms

Why does this problem occur?
Thanks sir g
Today&#39;s my exam🥶🥶🤕
Truly brilliant teaching approach. Thank You.
Thanks sir such awesome video. Now able to solve question view serializibility
there is no problem in content <br>but this is seriously should be a 2 minute video<br>Anyway good work sir
Sir you told all ur previous videos in English suddenly y u changed to hindi 😓😓
it&#39;s 3am i will rock in exam today
Sir, please make a video on COUNTING NO OF CONFLICT serializable and VIEW serializable, and no of schedules which do not conflict serializable but view serializable
Your explanations have such an amazing clarity!!
Sir please upload English video for this
Anyone from gate smashers?
Thank u Sanchit sir
Sir Last Video mein aapne bataya tha ki conflict serializability mein Agar graph ki condition banti hai toh wo consistent hai otherwise inconsistent hai...... (agar wo consistent nhi hai wo) VS bhi toh ho sakta hai uske bare mein toh kuch bataya hi nhi
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewzmv2jBlmM&amp;t=1m42s"">1:42</a> se start hai xD
But why put consistence inside inconsistence in your Venn diagram??<br>I think there should be separate block for inconsistence.<br>@knowledgegate
better than RBR 10000%
chutiya bana diye is video me fir
This is really true that very few people know about blind write point in view serializability. No one ever taught me that except i read it in a standard DBMS textbook, and from you now.
Best teacher sir
Sir agar aap nahin hote, <br>Then I would have failed in my DBMS exam but bcoz of you I got good grades in my exams. <br>You are excellent 💯💯👌👌🤘🤘
so thankyou much sir
why is &quot;Consistent&quot; inside of &quot;Inconsistent &quot; that is conflicting ??
get this men a shield....
koi etna satik kaise ho skta hai bhai.. 🎩s off to u sir...
sir,please post all your videos in english
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewzmv2jBlmM&amp;t=1m42s"">1:42</a> start
With due respect the figure is wrong, according to the figure all consistent schedules are inconsistent.
Sir time stamp ordering ka lecturer arrange karo ne
Thanks sir but also upload software engineering artificial intelligence as UGC net point of view thanks again sir
Please add videos on deadlock and 2 phase locking ... Please before 26th May @sanchitjain
one of the best teacher , But in this video everything is explained except the main content or idea of view serializability
All the best sir
no doubt sir, you have good knowledge.<br>but honestly, you are repeating same thing again and again in the video just for the sake of increasing it&#39;s length.

Sir ur Great❤
Wanted to know what&#39;s view serializability  and what I got to know was that view serializability can be conflict serializability, wtf ? Who wants to know that.
U r bestest teacher for GATE cse
Sir excellent videos....Sir can You upload video on Fourth normal form?
Please please improve your voice quality.
No sir it&#39;s not mandatory to be a blind write for view serializiblity . There are so many examples which are view serializible and no blind write is there . Please help me to clear my concept
Dhanyawad sir ji😆
Teaching is an art and you are the MAESTRO of it . Thank you Sir for all these lectures .God bless You.
Very nicely explained.. Thanks alot.. ☺️☺️👍🏼

POV : we are clearing our semesters in just two days without any efforts beacuse of him.
Extremely good explanation 💯
Anyone watching on the day of exam ?<br>I mean before 2 hours of exam
1 hour before exam
majorly complex
Understood Sir!
sir in first question there is no blind write, then how can it be view serializable?
Thank you sir, Your language and method is perfectly Understandable................
finally I got the correct explanation thank you
Thank you sir
first time samjh aaya h sir ,thank you soo much
Thank you so much sir ☺️🙏

Thank you so much sir. Along with learning about this topic, I am also learning the way you explain things. You have a great power of explaining tough concepts in an easy way. Thanks once again.
is w(a) changes a value in t1 even before commit so that in t2 r(a) see the updated value ?
Thank you very much 🙏
Thank you for the amazing explanation!
I watch your complete playlist of transactions control .....I was dammed good🔥....I wish I could attempt your offline class
Dependency graph and precedence graph are same or different.... please reply asap tommorrow I have exams
Great Explanation .
sir honest review dunga samjhaya apne bilkul sahe hai but request hai point to point samjhya kro kuch chezen aap flow main etni bol dete ho ki woh confusion create kr deti hai and kuch aise bhi log hai jinko DBMS ka &quot;D&quot; bhi nahe ata hai but they are trying hard to understand this topic un logon main se ek main bhi hun... main apko slow bolne k liye nahe keh raha hun woh apka nature hai usko aap hi handle kr sakte ho.. mene yeah vedio 3 4 bar dekhi kyun ki apki over knowledge or fast bolne ki speed ne mujhe confuse kr diya tha..
You took very easy examples but it was perfectly explained. Thank you so much.
Now i realize how stupid i am wasting a lot of time understanding what my teacher taught instead of just watching these videos
What difference does the bliend write make for view serializability?
No wonder why u r the best teacher 🙏
Salute your efforts sir
Why didn&#39;t we check blind write ?
we can use dependency graph. i learnt it on GateVidaylaya website.
Sir u are the best..🙏🙏
Thank you sir
Very nice explanation sir 🙏
Can u pls exlplain such things in english also..
Is this playlist enough for GATE and interviews? Also can anybody share their notes for these videos? It&#39;d be a great help!!!
too much ads
Sir har possible sechdul ke liye match krna hoga kya jab Tak hum dono ko view equivalent proof nahi kar pate hai
sir please upload videos in english

Wonderful teaching
Sir what is Serialization in DBMS??
Nice Sachin Don International
gate smasher vs knowledge gate
Thank you sanchit sir :)
Sanchit sir does this DBMS tutorial also applicable for Distributed DBMS.? please let me know sir ?
Hearty ❤️ Thank you sir...I have so much confusion and was in trouble from so much of time but after watching this video,It helps me a lot... Thank you so much again
Thanku so much sir ji
Hello sir actually m preparing for LIC AAO ( IT)  and I follow your videos starting from 1 march , actually my question is where to study I mean which book I preferred for theory actually my background electronic and communication engineering . please suggest sir
Sir your video really changed my life....May you achieve a great success and good life
In the first example...there is no blind write then how it is view serializable ?
Awesome 🌹🇮🇳🇮🇳
Could you please explain how you drew the serial schedule?
chaman chutiya hai thu saaley
why if there is not a blind write it will not be view serializable
Very helpful video.<br>Thanks.
Can someone explain how the first schedule is conflict serializable? If we draw a graph, won&#39;t we get a cycle ?
sir plz upload B and B++ tree
sir polygraph se ku nahi bataye
Watching him since School Level to UG  then also in PG and it will go on... Thank you sir for make our life easy. Teacher like you are needed more.
Love you man
sir last example conflict serializable nii tha to uske all 6 serial schedule<br> mai kaise convert kr skte hai?
Sir,how in 1st example it is conflict serializable?
KAAM KA BAAT LAST MEIN BOLTA HAI.... THUMBS DOWN
Nice explanation
Sir software engineering kahan se karna chahiye ?? Pls upload videos
Great explanation
✌️✌️✌️
Pls uploaded video on deadlocks and to solve the deadlocks
What will be the output if I do that 132 order  ?
I have confusion on VS when there will be more than 3 write operations like w1(x), w2(z),w3(y),w2(y)..how to arrange them
sir pls explain polygraph
kabhe bhe parhate waqt aisa mat kaha karo k &quot;Ye Mushkil concept hai&quot; <br>Aisa kahene se students k learning curve pe negative effect hota hai.
sir please make vedioes on concurrency control and dead lock.🙏🙏🙏🙏
Ravindra Babu sir has given us different method which is more easier. I am happy I have purchased it
Great explanation !!
sir plz make video on phase locking protocol plzzzzz
you are such an amazing person. Life saviour for students
My book says there is method of labeled precedence graph
Sir in the first example there was no blind write still you proved the schedule as view serializable.
Are you also watching this one day before your exams?
your videos work like a charm!
I think there is an error on the First Example.<br>The First Example shouldnt state that Schedule is View Serializable based on the following reasoning:<br>1st we know that the Conflict Serializable = no AND  2nd we know that the Blind Write = No so 3rd we know that the schedule = Not View Serializable
sir,Don&#39;t repeat single line again and again.....its taking boredom<br>else....explanation of concept is awsm...!!!<br>thank you!!!
I have a doubt... While checking view serializability  if in a transaction after final write there exist some read operation, will it effect view serializability??? plz reply
Plzzzz sir upload  concurrency control before net exam plz
Sir can you please make videos on locking and deadlocks please sir🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Hello sir there is a shortcut/technique to find if a schedule is view serializable, the technique is polygraphs. With the help of this we do not need to check that non serial schedule with all the serial schedules.
Very helpfull sir,enjoyed as well as lerned a lot...thank you sir🙏🙏🙏
Thank you so much for this video...
1st example doesn&#39;t have any blind write, so how could it be view equivalent?
What if S and S1 are view quivalent and S and S2 are not view equivalent? Then what about S? Is S is view equivalent or not?
Dhanyavad sir ji😆
Sir , I just wanted to know why there is lack of good teachers in INDIA.
can you also explain some ques like finding number of view or conflict equivalent schedule or recoverable schedules?

Thank you sir
Awesome Explanation Sir<br>Thank YOU💖
Perfect Example...dhanyavaad sir
Superb sir 😃😃😃
Bechara student 2, bahar khada bas tamasha dekh sakta hai 😢
Now I got what is recoverable schedule<br>Thank you sir 🙏
Speak in english
Thank you sir
💯💯💯👍
Non recoverable schedule&#39;s example 🤣🤣
Sir ye example to dirty read problem ka example h to consistent schedule kese ho skta h ye schedule?????<br>Someone please correct me if I am wrong 🤔🤔🤔
Sir you do very good job by sharing this kind of knowledge
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuEd3N9Nrs&amp;t=7m02s"">7:02</a>....🙌🙌
can&#39;t u make this video in english ....it would be helpful for those of us who couldn&#39;t listen and speak hindi
Thanks for the cheating tips 😬
Wha sir maza agaya 😍😍 phele itne pyaar se neta banake normalization karwa di and ab ye 💪🏻💪🏻🔥🔥Hats off to you sir ❤️❤️
Thnx u soo much sir......
Topic to hide main motive: Recoverable Schedule.<br>Main motive: Expert Cheating Advice.
No words to say about your explanation.l have never seen such a wonderful teacher till now really hats off to your knowledge and way of expressing concepts
thank you sir.. That is all I can say
wonderful explanation sir. hatsoff
Thank u so much sir
DOUBT: if T1 commits before T2 after that T2 fails and rolls back , then while T1 is commiting it would update the DB with whatever value was written by T2. But we know that T2 didnt execute at all. Isn&#39;t the DB inconsistent
Excellent Teaching Method...
Thank You for effective lectuers...
Sir can you please upload English video on this topic
Is it possible to provide separate buffer memory for all transactions if not then why ?
This person is teaching us for free thanks sir
best video on internet for recoverability.
Exam in 1 hour from now..wish me luck 😭
Dirty read bhi to yahi tha🙄🙄🙄🙄
arigato
Sir, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuEd3N9Nrs&amp;t=4m34s"">4:34</a> pe value database mein 5 ho jaani chahiye na kyunki T1 vaapas 10 minus kar dega? Rollback means everything rollback or just values in buffers?
thank you sirr :)
Thanks a lot sir I am a university student it helped me a lot I&#39;m following you from my 3rd sem when I read DSTL . A video on log based recovery sir plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
If T1 has committed and immediately after it Failure occurs in T2..what value will T2 obtain after rolling back? Considering T2 has done a dirty read..

The Best teacher on youtube i have ever found <br>i learnt alot from your videos <br>thank you so much
Thank you sir <br>I wants to share something to u<br>6 month phle mera 1st sem {msc} ka presentation th. Or mene deadlock topic choose kr lia th. Even mujhe deadlock hota kya h ye b pta ni th. Or ppt to bna li thi thoda bhut pdh kr.. presentation k 1 ghnte pahle mene apke deadlock k sare vdo dekhe the. Sir mujhe btane me bahot acha lg ra hai ki mera presentation sbse acha th class me and meri teacher ne kaha jb ap present kr rhe the to mujhe lga mene q apke jese ni smjhaaya... A big thank you sir😊
Love from Pakistan
Thank You Sir  !!!
One question: For recoverable scenario explained in this video.<br>A = 10,<br>T1, R(A) = 10, W(A) = A+ 10 = 20<br>T2, R(A) = 20, W(A) = A-5 = 15<br>So, Local Buffer = 15<br>If T1 commit but T2 fails then in Database commit value of A will be 15 but expected is 10. Then, how the example is Recoverable.
Thanks a lot🖤
kindly make videos on timestamp based ordering and validation based protocols.
Very nice sir
sir thanks fr teaching. but topic ko khichte bht hai aap. thoda fast complete kijiye
Thanks sir but also upload Artificial Intelligence video&#39;s
Superb example  of two students to explain recoverable schedule.
This is really helpful.
Superb sir...... Thankyou very much for making this video.....😊😊😊
sir,how i can know that &quot;there isn&#39;t any dirty read&quot;?
you are great sir . thank u  very much. i love your teaching
awesome explaination<br>it really help me to understand topics  one day before exam
Nicely explained! Thanks a lot!
sir plz listen there is a very big confusion...<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuEd3N9Nrs&amp;t=10m44s"">10:44</a> but sir agar T2 rollback krega to  database ki value  fir bhi 15 hi rahegi lekin  agar T2 ne transaction kiya hi ni to database ki value 20 honi chahiye thi na???????????? So is this condition also a irrecoverable?? plz respond.
Thanku so much sir.....your teaching techniques are awesome....thanku
please Sir Use English
God level explanation👍👌
:/ no english videos on this topic?
Sir, How can T2-R(a) be a dirty read when those are separate transaction so they will have different memory buffers. Essentially the T2 should read the DB value as T1 was not committed.
What is the difference between cascadeless schedule and recoverable schedule ? Someone please explain
Sir, tell me one that if n transaction running concurrently then a failure is occur in a particular transaction   because of logical error(say T1)   and m number of transaction   <br> transaction which are directly or indirectly depending upon T1 due to dirty read then all n-1 transactions(m and n-1-m)  roll back when T1 roll back or only m transaction rollback .As no one committed yet. Sir, please  reply this question
Sir does local buffer concept prevails in real life ? Because practically utill and unless a transaction is commited the value is read from database only ...<br><br>So in your example how R(A) in T2 is reading 20 ?? It should read 10 right , since T1 has not commited ....?? PLEASE REPLY !!
Sir I have read learned from many ways...  this is the cleared my concept. .. Sir hats off to you..
thanks
Thanks Sir
You&#39;re lectures r great sir... <br>Thanku sir..
example was good..
very very nice explanation...thank you sir
Dhanyavad sir ji😆
You explain this topic better than RBR
Sir for any DR if T does r(a) it reads a&#39;s valuefrm DB and T2 frm same schedule does r(a) reads a frm LB why t2 not get a&#39;s value frm DB also
Tank u sir. U r grt
You are awesome..ek ek point clear krdia
perfect
sir if i done ur videos is it enough?
Sir all topic Ka vedio ek series me nahi hai
Gud job
thank u sir, your lectures are very helpfull, they helped me a lot for preparing my Univ Exams.
Nice videos! Please post some videos on Query Optimizations
Suppose T2 first reads a value from T1, and then T1 reads a value from T2. Then there is always going to be a chance of irrecoverability. What do we do call and what do we do in such cases?
awesome sir but these words are so small for yr great work
Sir dirty read occur only when a transaction T1 reads data written by T2 and T1 commit before T2, so when the order of commit is same, there is no dirty read, please clarify.
sir, perfect example diya hai aapne exam mai bhulne ka chance he nahi hai   🤣🤣🤣
waiting for coming videos sir
Sir You have amazing and unique talent of teaching.<br>thankyou sir.
Thanks a  lot, sir for your uploads. You are doing a wonderful job helping students :)

Do you have any website that provides written notes
Thankyou so much sir! for this important concept...
Thank u so much sir 😇🙏🙏🙏
You are best teacher sir.Thank you so much for providing lectures.
Sir, ky sabhi process k liye local buffer same hota hai? I mean t2 jb read kr raha h toh vo t1 k value Kyu read Kiya, uska buffer toh different hona chaiye n?
i don&#39;t have word to express your teaching . pranam sirji .i want to be teacher like you because your way of explanation is very  simple and clear .

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvLHkPCjCtk&amp;t=2m59s"">2:59</a> confilict to hoga na??? R(a) and W(a) of T1 with W(a) of T2???
As per the diagram if a schedule is strict then it is also casecadeless. But as per logic if a schedule is casecadeless then it is strict also. Because casecadeless removes only blind read and strict removes both. Please reply Sir.
awesome.....also im 1000th person to like ur video  :)
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvLHkPCjCtk&amp;t=2m55s"">2:55</a> sir it is not conflict serializable, as there are two write operation working on the same variable of different transaction
Sir, Is &#39;S1&#39; schedule a recoverable schedule because I am confused about how the system will recover if there is a failure just after &#39;C1&#39; commit?
sir aapne s3 ko strict bataaya but aapki definition ke according s3 strict nahi hai
Last diagram is awesome  sir total concept is included int it  <br>Awesome sir🌹🌹🌹🇮🇳🇮🇳

Sir @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvLHkPCjCtk&amp;t=2m48s"">2:48</a>(Schedule S1), what if T2 fails after commitment of T1, won&#39;t it create problem, as T1 is writing value made by T2 to main Database. When T2 will rollback, it will seem that T2 has not done any work, but the value made by T2 will be there in main Database.

sir i think  in the whole DBMS it is most difficult to understand.......i will have to see this video again and again.......
SIR CAN YOU PROVIDE VIDEOS IN ENGLISH
in case of read why we will take  maximum of  (W.T.S(Q) , T.S(Ti))
finally got the whole conecpt with the touch up of  &quot; junior ko allowed h senior ko nai  h&quot; lol!
Tomorrow is my DBMS exam and today I am here
💯👍🏻
Harkat was Doing pushups on the stage so the professor also joined to motivate the students
Junior ko allowed h ,Senior ko allowed nhi h 😁

In write case it is ensured that T.S(Ti) is not less than WTS(Q) so max will always be Ti time stamp. Why is there a need to get max in write case ?

Great video. Complex topics, simple explanation. Can only be done by LEGENDS.
Easiest explanation.... Highly appreciate your efforts sir. Thank you very much.
Transaction paani peene gya tha...lol
Sir Your Videos Are too explanatory they are too good <br><br>You should change Datil to detail <br>Keep on making content
Junior ko allowed  senior ko nhi <br>😂😁
I think, in case of &quot;OK&quot;, WTS(Q) should be equal to TS(Ti) and not max(WTS(Q), TS(Ti)) because we will reject Ti if WTS(Q) &gt; TS(Ti). Kindly correct me if I am wrong.
hod wala example pass and Aya humka

Really good content sir, which helps me to understand the concept.<br>Thank you for the knowledge
Thanks a lot sir I got my concepts clear......keep updating more videos.they are of great use for students like me 😉😊😁
Tomarrow is my Advance Database Exam and i am watching this video....You cleared my concepts sir...Alot of respect
Datil...
Detail ki jagah datil ho gya hai ....Achha hua dalit nhi likha galti se 😁😁
Ti requests for read(Q):<br>In first case when it has to roll back<br>But even after rolling back and then reading the data item, it will read the data item which has already been modified by Tj. How come we allow it then??
Gate ke bahar vali harkaten yaad aa gai sir <br>Which are not allowed for our HOD
Haha, transaction yahan ban chuka hai Ghajini ... Quite funny.

deadlock kb pdhaya??? in which video???
no preemption ,hold and wait, mutual exclusion and circular wait- conditions for deadlock
Thankyou sir for the amazing explanation of all the protocols you have explained so so so amazingly. I did not cram a single thing. I could understand easily and remember all of it
now this topic is not for kids  that&#39;s why view are half of the initial videos
Dbms asan hai .....perr etnaa logical hai kee aajj demagg ghumm gayaa hai.... (Continue watching)
The kind of HOLD you have on the topic is SHOCKING for normal people.
Complex topics, simple explanation. It is only possible by LEGENDS like Sanchit Sir.
Why it suffer From starvation?<br> If a tranjection roll back then its time stamp <a href=""http://increase.so/"">increase.So</a> next time it will get a chance of execution So there be no starvation

Can thomas write be only used if both transaction performs blind write or it does not matter ?

sir jiska time stamp jyada h usme aap write op. perform karwa rhe h junior me kese a pta chlata h sir ki junior me op. hoga ye meko smjh nhi aa rha
Thanks sir g
Excellent explanation sir.
gazab re bhaiwaaa ekdum teh dil jeet lehale
in the 3 transactions example, what if w(Q) of T1 was the last operation and w(Q) of T3 didn&#39;t exist only or was there before T1&#39;s w(Q). do we still ignore it?
Very good explanation
If you would have made this video before GATE 2019, I would have believed ki how u think, and we all would have gotten 2 marks for that question on Thomas write rule.
I really  appreciate your wonderful work sir. THANK YOU for everything.
Very Nice Video Sir. Keep Posting!
T3 to apne man ki sochke aya h use jo krna tha vo bhai voi karega :) i love the way you explain every concept..
update WTS at last by T3 , wts(Q) should be 3 ??
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLcEOs24Q3s&amp;t=10m29s"">10:29</a>, Sir, why W1(Q) is blind write as T1 is reading then writing. I think only W2(Q) and W3(Q) is blind write? Kindly correct if I am wrong.
why are we allowing the write operation on t2? Because anyway that is also not required. The final value should be what t3 writes right?
Even if there are blind writes it does not mean that schedule is view serialuzable. Polygraph is used in this case.
This video ain&#39;t got much views coz  I don&#39;t think any one had any will left to go on.
Please correct the video title, it&#39;s written as Thomal, very nice videos, so helpful.
Thank you, sir, for teaching from a university point of view really good lectures.
Thnku sir

As of now this vdeo has 2375 views, soon as october-november comes, theses views are gonna hike!
