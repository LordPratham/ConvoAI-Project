The major differences are sets are represented by flower bracket or curly bracket while list in square bracket.

In a set all values are unique. But in a list we have an order and can adress to any of its values by index\\nCan we rename the address to a number or name of our choice?\\nI tried to run this command for getting the address of variable and it is changing the address everytime i run the command print(id(a)) in pycharm for macos, can you please help to understand why is it doing different from what you are explaining ?\\nList is an ordered collection of elements in the data structure of Python which allows duplication and is defined by square brackets [ ]; SET is non ordered collection of elements which does not allow duplication of elements and is defined by curly brackets {}. since no duplication is allowed in sets it offers an advantage to look out for specific objects with more efficiency.\\nIf we want immutable data we have set, here we don&#39;t have index value of any data and it doesn&#39;t allow duplication.<br>If we need mutable data, with all the type of variation we have list, here we can define integer, string with each data having index number.\\nlist is ordered but set is unordered , in list we can have reptation of values but in sets all values should be unique\\nvery informative!

Learned it the hard way from a code like this:<br><br>a=[1,2,3]<br>b=a<br>for i in range(1,4):<br>    for num in a:<br>        b.append(num+i*10)<br><br>The intent was to make a list of this pattern: [1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, ...]. But since python uses the same memory address for a and b, appending list &quot;b&quot; will also change list &quot;a&quot;. With the for loop trying go through a list that keeps expanding each iteration, the loop becomes infinite. To avoid this issue, make &quot;a&quot; a tuple (a=tuple(a)) after the line &quot;b=a&#39;. This will result in &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; having different addresses and less likely to be mixed up.\\nCan we find the number inside box with help of I&#39;d ???\\nInteresting\\nHow to create spool file in python ?

Thanks Navin &lt;3\\nSir, what to do if we want to print all the numbers from nums divisible by 5????\\nI want to find all the numbers in the list which are divisible by 5. And in this case as you said we dont have to use break. Then if i want to print not found if no numbers in the list are divisible by 5. How do we do?? i want to print not found only 1 time in this case also. <br><br>i am not using break in this case and still if i want to print not found only once, then how do we do. <br>I hope you understood my doubt sir. <br><br>Pls respond, i am not able to find the answer for this in any other videos\\nsir else: part will execute always in case with for this means u r printing not found intentionally ,so u can print without else part also !

I took me 6 complete hours to figure out how to do it. I hope sharing my experience will save your time.<br>1. I typed &#39; pip  install numpy&#39; in cmd and it showed a warning &#39;you are using pip version 20.2.3, however version 20.2.4 is available&#39;. I installed the newer version but it wasn&#39;t that necessary. <br>2. However I kept gettng a messase everytime i tried installing numpy saying &quot;microsoft visual c++ 14.0 is required.&quot; So what you have to do here you have to install <br>(i) Visual studio 2019 using visual studio installer. Don&#39;t delete the visual studio installer app.<br>(ii) Visual C++ redistributable from the official microsoft website<br>3. Then you have to run the visual studio installer app again to modify the visual studio installed on your machine.Go to workloads and choose &#39;Desktop development with C++&#39;&#39; and tick the &#39;MSVC v142-VS2019 C++....&#39; and &#39;windows 10 SDK&#39; options ( try to tick the recent ones).<br>this installation will take around 30 min.<br>4. Then you restart your machine and type &#39;pip3 install numpy&#39; in cmd. Mine worked after this. Thanks Navin Reddy sir.

You are a genius.\\nSir,<br>In the scenario of list, original values got changed, should we create a copy of the list in the function always in order to prevent overriding or original values ?\\n# def fun(i,a):<br>#     print(id(a))<br>#     if i&gt;=len(a)//2:<br>#         return<br>#     fun(i+1, a+[&quot;a&quot;]) <br>#     print(i,a)<br>    <br>def fun(i,a):<br>    print(id(a))<br>    if i&gt;=len(a)//2:<br>        return<br>    a.append(&quot;a&quot;)<br>    print(id(a))<br>    fun(i+1, a)<br>    print(i,a)<br><br>a=[1,2,3]<br>print(id(a))<br>fun(0,a)<br><br>i think this example might be helpful\\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijXMGpoMkhQ&amp;t=5m13s\">5:13</a> time was <a href=\"http://amazing.lol/\">amazing.LOL</a>\\nDude, you speak like a bullet train...\\nThank you  Navin Sir, i have gone through many sites but your tutorial is really outstanding....\\nThank you so much for making this video i was breaking my head over this as in case of immutable variables everytime  a change happens python will create a new memory but for mutable variables it uses the same memory so if see the list before and after the calling the function both will have the same value.\\nReally solved my confusion, a new python learner\\nplease not so fast. explain slowly.\\nLots of love and respect sir !❤\\nfor the first I did not understand\\nPass by value: We pass the copy value of the object and changing the copy of object will not change the original object.<br><br>Pass by reference: We pass a reference or memory to the function and changing the object in the function will ultimately change the original object as they both reference to the same memory location.<br><br>However in python,<br>Concept of pass by value or pass by reference is dependent entirely on the mutability of the object passed to the function.<br><br>If the passed object is immutable like a number or string. i.e changing them would create entirely new object. Passing by value comes to play.<br><br>However in case of mutable objects like lists. Changing the value will cause it to change the original object directly. This feature portrays the pass by reference.\\nCause these videos are three years old.\\nAre you still available to make me understand in more simple way.\\nSir, I&#39;ve seen 32lectures before this, but I m totally confused with this one.\\nsir this was not clear sir...let you give another explanation about this topic sir...\\nThe way you teach.. really amazing.. Thank you sir\\nCompletely defeats the point I&#39;m lookin for. How to pass data into the function.  Nobody  needs to know the values are sharing a memory space.\\nhello sir<br>A big thanks for ur videos which are really helping me a lot can u please share me the notebook for all the videos merge,i need not book if u have that possibly try to send me which indeed helpful further my internship, as well as my placement kindly, share it as soon as possible to my email id\\nHi Navin, though I love most other videos for python and would recommend others to learn from you. But am so sorry to let you know that I did not understand anything in this video tutorial. Thanks anyway. Keep sharing, keep growing\\nSir, if the value of a is updated by function but then why value of a is printed as 10...and if the parameter(a)  that is taken by the function is not the parameter which we have assigned value 10,then why the ID of a is same as the parameter(a)  passed through the function..\\nwhat i understood is  int and string are immutable, there value is passed only in defined function and not to the whole following code.<br>while list and dictionary pass the updated value to the following code out of user defined function\\nThis is confusing!\\nfor the 1st time, could not understand the lecture at all sir....\\nConfused\\ndef foo(x):\\r<br>    x = [&#39;def&#39;, &#39;abc&#39;]\\r<br>    return id(x)\\r<br>q = [&#39;abc&#39;, &#39;def&#39;]\\r<br>print(id(q) == foo(q))<br><br>why is this false ? list is mutable.\\nTill now every video is  clear but this video is confusing\\n☹\\nI dont know coding intially. so im like &#39;Hey,, PYTHON is so easy&#39; ,,untill this video....\\nThe simple concept is integers are immutable so we can&#39;t change or update orginal value(the value stored before update).List is mutable so we can update the original value\\nSadly,  your explanation wasn’t clear nor concise<br><br>I wasn&#39;t able to understand this particular video but other videos seem to be fine so far\\nif you make an another video over this topic then please share the link\\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijXMGpoMkhQ&amp;t=4m42s\">4:42</a> lmao\\nbut,  what if i want to pass a mutable object into a function, than store the output of the function in a variable and than I need to reuse the initial value of the mutable object but i can not because it&#39;s been changed?<br>how can i get around that?\\nyou rushed...\\nIm sorry, this is confusing and hard to follow..\\nNot understood this video\\n4 8 13 lines are same y writing many times\\nworst video in the playlist not a single concept is clear\\nThis series is very much helpful for students like me, who is switching from Java to Python. Thanks Navin sir.😀\\nthis video was totally above my head....u totally confused me 😵😵\\nI m not able to understand... What was that??\\nSir can you please explain this concept briefly...... i am unable to catch the concept\\nSir can u explain why u mentioned that integer and Strings are immutable ?\\ntoo complicated .....\\nin filmy fantasy...<br>value = body clone<br>reference = aatma(soul)<br><br>so <br>pass by value is pass  clone<br>pass by reference = pass  aatma<br><br>in python we dont have anything..<br>it depends on what the animal is..if its immutable(non changeable) like cow,dog,yak..they cant change themselves hence if you want to create a new yak with one horn then god will create new yak and not update the exsiting species..<br><br>if animal is mutable...like humans..girls and boys..they can change ..they can makeup and change the gender looks..<br><br>lol..i dont know it is helps someone\\ndef up(x):\\r<br>    x = 9\\r<br>    print(&quot;x &quot;,x)\\r<br>    \\r<br>up(4).................<br>What is the use of passing this &quot;4&quot;?????\\nnot a clear definition ji\\ncant understand bro\\nI am confused . I really didn’t understand this video if someone can help me\\nFollowing your python series this was the first lecture vedio that i couldn&#39;t understand\\nWonderfully explained\\nThe best video . got all my doubts about arguments in functions in python . and in just 8 minutes .!\\nHe is the exact senior developer, we see in the memes.....<br>Thank you navin ✌️\\nworst video in terms of clarity in this course.\\nbro telugu lo chayachuga bro\\noh god!!!  as the array comes, i started watching every video the second time .\\n@Navin sir, can u please explain this concept in a new video, slightly confused here\\nIf you give with any practical example that would be more helpful. I have price of commodities, after few days the price has change  on review I need to see both prices how to do that?\\nNot understanding this video can you brief it in more detail\\nThank you !!\\nRubbish tbh... not explaining the concept...\\nNot getting concept clear\\n𝙎𝙄𝙍 𝙋𝙇𝙀𝘼𝙎𝙀 𝙀𝙇𝘼𝘽𝙊𝙍𝘼𝙏𝙀 𝙏𝙃𝙄𝙎 𝘾𝙊𝙉𝘾𝙀𝙋𝙏 𝘼𝙂𝘼𝙄𝙉 𝘽𝙀𝘾𝘼𝙐𝙎𝙀 𝙄 𝘼𝙈 𝙐𝙉𝘼𝘽𝙇𝙀 𝙏𝙊 𝙂𝙍𝘼𝘽 𝙄𝙏.....\\nGood sir first of all u all should read about pass by value and pass by reference and then u should watch this video i m sure u will get the all stuff 👍☺️☺️☺️\\nConfusing sir\\nYeah enjoy 👍\\nIMHO, its easier to think that integers and strings are passed by value while lists are passed by reference.\\nSir I didn&#39;t undestood properly\\nThis is little bit confusing can u make it more clear pass by Val --- pass by ref\\nIn my very honest opinion, belonging to a non-IT field (and also Python being the first language I am learning, and this playlist being my first source for it), I think you are losing the touch from the last video sir. This series of videos started off great, but I am not able to understand and grasp some things now. Please focus more on clearing the concepts rather than your fluency or other things. A big thank you for all the videos until now. You are the reason I got hooked to Python, but please clarify better. Thanks.\\nI feel not clear... 😕☹️🙄\\nDude u r confusing 🤦🏻\\u200d♂️\\nsorry sir i cant understand this.can u please add another video for this concept\\nyour code is not working for me\\nsir,I can&#39;t able to understand this concept\\nSir i am not able to understand this concept. Big fan of yours\\nThank you sooooo much bro for the tutorial this is very Understandable and useful 😇\\nGod better best\\n@2.00 ,technically 10 should b printed ,why it does print 8..nt gettin it\\nSir, <br>I cannot understand why the output of both the prints is same even though we are changing the element 1 in list in update(list) . Please kindly reply my comment\\nI&#39;m Immensly Addicted to ur teaching videos sir thank for teaching us.....\\nCan u explain this concept again...\\nbakwassss\\nThank you!\\nALMOST AT 1M\\nSir we need a separate video on pass by value and pass by reference, as we didn&#39;t understood the concept .']\n","['Python for Beginners (Full Course) | Programming Tutorial', 'PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3', 'Telusko', '#34 Python Tutorial for Beginners | Types of Arguments in Python', 'eci9iU_s6Ag', 595.0, '503476', '8010', '\\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eci9iU_s6Ag&amp;t=5m06s\">5:06</a>,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eci9iU_s6Ag&amp;t=7m24s\">7:24</a>\\nImagine using sum ( a,*b, *c ) 🤔 what will happen ?\\nAfter 4 years, tutorial still made sense!!\\nHow To Add A Tuple and Int\\ncan we concatenate int and str\\nsir i am not getting 123 in last\\nThanks for the video\\nCan we do in variable length arguments we are using function to add one or more values.

No need to return another function. An example:<br><br>def division(a,b): return a/b<br>def subtraction(a, b): return a - b<br><br>def do_operation(operation, a, b):<br>    return operation(a, b) if a &gt; b else operation(b, a)<br><br>print(do_operation(division, 4, 12)) # 3.0<br>print(do_operation(division, 12, 4)) # 3.0<br>print(do_operation(subtraction, 4, 12)) # 8<br>print(do_operation(subtraction, 12, 4)) # 8\\nCan we not create just one function as a decorator?

Thanks for explaining decorators🙏\\nFor people saying missing @ in the tutorial, please find the equivalent usage done by the tutor. You could either go with<br>div=smart_div(div) or use @&lt;decorator_name&gt; like @smart_div on top of function div. Both are same\\nWhy you using this func()?\\nisnt it best practice to put *args, **kwargs in the decorator?\\nBasically there is a missing point, that is we have to use “@“ for using decorators after defining them. And even wrapper functions explanations are missing\\nI&#39;ve seen some people use classes instead of functions to create the decorator. He implemented the <i>_init_</i> and <i>_call_</i> functions within It and that was it. Can someone explain what&#39;s the difference between using classes and functions?\\nMost coding teachers cannot explain anything. You can. This made sense.\\nFunction parameters are easy in Haskell, F-sharp etc\\nplease sir  anybody tell me that where i can do coding in android phone\\nIf decorated is not there in python then how can you do it? can you plz answer this\\nHallo Navin ,, this is great 👍🔥\\nYour presence makes the video so much better✨️\\nWhy is this better than a plain, straightforward call to the original function inside a new function without all the abstraction of decorating?

Tread carefully.\\nAmazing explanation..sir...thank you thank you so much\\nI wish you modularized the code, smat_div function in another file :(\\nA lot of arm waving but no motivation as to why one would use an inner function.  I think the answer is that inner functions are created so that the inner function changes the behavior of the original function without changing the original function.  That is a decorator is a made up construct.<br><br>,Also, what happened to the notation using “@“?\\nHow&quot; inner &quot; function got executed<br>With out calling it🙄\\nhow does inner get called and when? what i have understood is we are passing the div function as parameter to the decorator function, which is returning inner_function. Now, the inner_function object or address will be overridden in the ‘div’ because we are capturing the returned function in it. After this, whenever we call div, the execution goes to inner_function in the decorator.\\nwas bit tricky to understand\\nThis is the best example I found to understand decorator...😀\\nWhy don&#39;t we return the same passed function in decorators?\\nHey Navin, Thank you for sharing your amazing knowledge with you, This is the first video in 44 videos which I found a bit harder to grasp.\\nI just realized that you being physically present in the video makes such a big difference to how much attention I pay. There are tons of videos out there but your videos work for me because there is someone teaching and I can see them typing the code. The expressions and gestures also help with the learning, maybe subconsciously we understand better if knowledge transfer is backed by facial expressions.

If there are any executable statements in the imported module.(like function calling, print statement, input etc) after definning all functions. (I am from c background i dont know what is the exact word instead of  &quot;compiler&quot; in python ) the compiler will first execute those  executable statements which are present in calc. Py module and the executes  the executable statements in demo. Py...<br>There is a problem only in starting.. If u dont want statement of calc or importing module which are present after defining of function use  condition <i>_name_</i> == __main__..

I&#39;m moving along with Python so quickly.<br><br>Only criticism I have is in the explanation of Class and Instance.  It&#39;s not that you don&#39;t get there, but it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re skirting around the simple answer:  Seems that the best way I&#39;ve seen this described is to say that when you ask someone about a thing...  What is this?  It&#39;s a phone.   That&#39;s it&#39;s class.  The class is phone.  We know from this, the basic attributes (It&#39;s size, weight, and color), but when we ask what <del>TYPE</del> of phone it is, we&#39;re then talking about an Instance.  IT&#39;s instance is the Motorola Nifty Call &amp;trade;, and it has the same attributes as the class (phone), but in the instance of it we see that things are different.  Bigger or smaller, more memory, faster processor etc.   This leads us into understanding inheritance, and polymorphism in later videos.   <br><br>I LOVE THE WORK HERE!!!\\n👽👽👽👽\\nI find myself here without difficulty or efforts of climbing high cliffs but still took the gradual climb up the hill without being tired, to get to a place called OOPs ...I feel you (Navin, respectfully) transitioned us from simple programming, building all the foundation and setting the stage without us knowing, to OOP. ...nice approach, not to mention the very likeable way you teach like many others have already mentioned.

What do you say ? Python should not let us change class variables data using object. And if so then, it should change for all existing objects, thats how meaningful concept of class variables comes into play. C++ has no instanced variables concept for this reason only.  Abstraction should be same for all instances i.e. interface box should be same.\\ni fckn love you, thats the teaching\\nbye-bye that I feel this never end the python language\\nWhen I give c1. wheels=5 it still changes...\\nHmm it seems like static in java...\\nUsing object name also we can change the static variables I.e. instead of car.wheels we can use c1.wheels and the value gets updated!!! Please explain\\nin your previous videos you said that objects store in heap memory and here you saying that object store in namespace. namespace and heap memory are same or they are different.\\nEven You can change Class variables using  object.But It will affect variables of that object\\nWhat is local variable ???\\nlegendary Sir ji\\nwe can still have two different values of wheels if we use object names instead of class name. please resolve my query\\ni am getting attribute error pls anyone help me\\nthank you random indian man for letting me survive this years ict class\\nwhat is local variable means???, how to declare???\\nSir please tell us how did you edit your videos with such animation<br>Please sir<br>If possible then try to make a separate video on it.

And as usual :). <br>May be worth also, explaining the importance of &quot;modifying class variables with class names only&quot; and  contrasting the effect of &quot;modifying class variables with object names&quot;.\\nThis right side explanation makes it more clear and easy to understand\\nhi sir, hope you are doing good and staying fit and healthy. I really love your teaching . I have a question. Here I am accessing the static variable outside the class using class name. But when I am trying to change the value of the static variable outside the class using object name it is changing the value of wheel for both the objects. For eg, c1=Car()<br><br>c2=Car()<br><br>c1.company=&#39;Toyota&#39;<br><br>c2.wheels=7<br><br>print(<a href=\"http://c1.company/\">c1.company</a>,c1.mileage,c1.wheels)<br><br>print(<a href=\"http://c2.company/\">c2.company</a>,c2.mileage,c2.wheels) <br><br>This code should give error right ?!! but instead it is changing the value of wheel for the objects. Kindly clear out my confusion. Thank you sir and always stay blessed.\\nHow does namespace differ from heap memory?

C(A, B) will pull from A in the case of duplicates, and C(B, A) will pull from B in the case of duplicates.<br><br>In the case of duplicate methods between parent classes, you can choose which of the parent classes to use a method from by explicitly calling the method within the child class. Instead of using super().method() you can decide which instance of the duplicate to use by naming it explicitly. If your class inherits A before B, like in C(A, B), but you want to use a method from B that also exists in A, use B.method() to use it.<br><br>super(). looks like a good shortcut for when you know you will not be dealing with choosing between duplicates, and you don&#39;t want to explicitly mention which class to call from.\\nWhen considering MRO, does it consider the name of the class?

I really insist on that question, because it will ruin all the reasoning behind the multiple inheritance...\\nMy code gives en error when I change the class C&#39;s order B,A to A,B\\nAll legends should be like this 😎😎\\ninstead of defining class C(A,B) you call as  class C(B,A) to get the init of class B\\nAwesome Awesome Awesome\\nIf Possible, Please conduct live session on python programming in this weekend Naveen sir.<br>It will very helpful to revise what we&#39;re learn.<br><br>Really, enjoy the session, clearly understand inheritance concepts -&gt; single-level, multi-level &amp; Multiple Inheritance<br>super() method usage, <i>_init_</i> constructor  and Method Resolution Order in inheritance.<br><br>Best python teacher ever in my life.<br>anyone want to do python crash course with-in 1 month, it is very helpful.<br><br>I have storage testing background,  this course very helpfully for my career.

I have a question though... when you say MRO is left to right, is this because the call to Class(A,B) reads A first (as it is on left)... if we swap them around to Class(B,A) will it pick B first? Or is there some other abstract thing at play here... order of top to bottom? What if we swapped Class A and Class B around, so Class B was at the top?\\nThanks a lot\\nThis is the best best online course I have found till date. Best teacher Everrrrrrr\\nSir I have a question what should we do if we want to call constructors of both super classes in subclass(in multiple inheritance).\\nenglish is my 3rd language so it&#39;s a bit harder for me to understand, but this guy explains it so good that im not having a hard time trying to understand what he says. what im trying to say is that i like this chanel and its better than payed courses.\\nThank you very much , I am not able to understand this concept properly you help me made it. But I will also prefer to read python documentation to understand concept more properly after videos😊👌\\nAs you told if we have multiple inheritance,it starts from left then,what if we want to access right method?\\nThank you for your spoon feeding sir\\nHow many types are there in inheritance sir ? because just now i found Hybrid Inheritance and Hierarchical Inheritance .\\nhow to use init from both super classes?\\nBrother Navin I think your this video is INCOMPLETE, Bcos in Multiple Inheritance how to get Class B <i>_Init_</i> you did not show\\nthanks a lot sir !!!!

Really Thank you . Videos are really helpful. I love your way of teaching. God bless you.\\nExcellent explanation. Due to MRO, this is printing init of Class A, how to print init of class B without changing (A, B) to (B, A) in Class C and do not want to print class A init. (pls note that, adding super in each class, print init in for all classes, I am looking to print for Class B only)\\nNavin, could u pls explain how to call B&#39;s constructor here or any method in class B.\\nNavin, u r just amazing. Am really motivated to learn n teach like you. 👍😊\\ntext is not clearly visible so difficult to understand\\nthe funny line is when he said C is completely biased for B class\\nSir, what if in MRO we want class B init in calling class C???\\nExcellent way of teaching.

Now students of classes both A and B must bring one even if B class don&#39;t have its use. So the class A will have a set of compass, rulers, pencils etc in it. But since students of class B don&#39;t have any use, they will just bring one with a pencil or even just empty (pass) because its compulsory to bring one in to be in the hall.<br><br>If a parent class has an abstract method, every child must also have one. So each child will have to define one of thier own.<br><br>In duck typing, It isn&#39;t necessary to define the parent class method for each child classes. it just simply have to point to the class where the particular method lies. Here we would have to define for each.<br><br>I hope this helps\\ncan a non abstract class have abstract methods in python ..in java,c++ its not but what about python\\nnice\\nSir..can u explain acm ICPC 2015 world finals problem c catering in python..??\\nyes\\nPrevious background was waaaayyyyyy better\\nyes it will  work but we did not get anything\\nHe doesnt want to work today\\nI Think u missed some logic, i have to refer other utubers to understand about abstract classes and methods., i did not understand in reverse i got messed up., i learned from other videos about navin&#39;s made mistake by taking whiteboard, bcos of white board it is confusing, actually abstract means ABSTRACT METHOD, Computer class forcing by making must to use abstract methods in those classes.\\nWhen he types println! upppss! :p\\nsir we cant import abs it is giving error<br>plzz help it out\\nhow can we define a variable in abstract\\nperfect\\nThank you for wasting the time\\nit was soooo confusing\\r<br>\\r<br> pta nhi kiya kri jarha hoooo\\nConcept is not reached\\nSummary:<br>abstract method is a method which only has declaration and doesn&#39;t have definition.<br>a class is called abstract class only if it has at least one abstract method.<br>when you inherit a abstract class as a parent to the child class, the child class should define all the abstract method present in parent class.<br>if it is not done then child class also becomes abstract class automatically.<br>at last, python by default doesn&#39;t support abstract class and abstract method, so there is a package called ABC(abstract base classes) by which we can make a class or method abstract.\\nThanks for the video. but you can make it better\\nThe same program i have executed but still the same error<br>TypeError: Can&#39;t instantiate abstract class ChildABST with abstract methods AbsMet<br>here in the video naveen executed successfully but it&#39;s not when i tried with the same, what&#39;s wrong it has i dont understand\\nno&#39;\\nCan you please explain more on why do we need abstract classes?

Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose again on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don&#39;t end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won&#39;t grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don&#39;t have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don&#39;t let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn&#39;t want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him &quot;sincerely&quot; if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won&#39;t lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don&#39;t know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don&#39;t want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you.

Regular thread does not parallelize i guess. can u check and confirm pls\\nAlso btw can you confirm if the multi threading in python is parallel execution . I think not. its restricted by GIL. Only multi processing does a parallel run. Muti threading still in python is time sliced run due to interpreter limitations.... Can you check and confrm. A curb around this is threadpool executer\\ncan you as well post a video on how to limit the number of threads running at one instance.... Lets say I have a function that will take a parameter and will run accordingly producing different results.... But the list of parameters to be passed is more than 10000... The parameters comes to me from a csv list. Iterating through the parameter list I should spin off my functions.... I wanted to run this same function in parallel say 8 threads at an instance as i iterate through my parameters from the file in loop. Can you explain me how you run through the parameters and execute the functions in paralllela and restric it to 8 at a time. I will have to begin next thread only when the thread could &lt;8 lets say 2 out of 8 threads complete it should add another 2 threads to maintain 8 count.....\\nGood explanation....

Formally, all one has to do to run a python program is execute a python source file (That isn&#39;t compiled in any way) to run it, hence it is by official definition interpreted (Of course I know the official Interpreter works by generating an intermediate language while executing Python scripts, but it is still considered interpreted)\\nsir please tell me ,what is pvm already in every operating system  which  run  to help python code ???\\nyour videos are just awsome,i saw your 2014 java video also and I want to appreciate you how much u change yourself. the way you are talking now it seems clearly how much you build up your confidence level. plz make new java video also bcoz in old videos ur voice is not clear. stay happy and motivated also\\nSir I need a big help.

That is why textbooks are saying Python is Interpreted.

Plz answer sir\\nof this code there is no output generated\\nI&#39;ve an issue with this technique of binary search.<br>If the length of a list with odd numbers and we write code according to the technique that you describe,  I mean setting the upper or lower bound to mid according to the searched element is great or less so we&#39;ll reach to a condition where mid will be an odd index number which is 2nd last element and upper bound which is last element of list and when we find new mid so it will always give the same index which is 2nd last element of list and it will never be changed. <br>Suppose length of a list is 5 and we are trying to find the last element of list so there will be a condition where lower bound will be 3 and upper bound will be 4 and when we&#39;ll be find new mid so it will be <br>Mid = ( 3 + 4 ) // 2 = 3 and it will repeatedly give the same index for the mid.\\nWhen iam giving last element to search its not giving the correct answer it is showing before index\\nI have completed whole python course but still I was having problem with binary searching so here I am\\nThe upper bound should be changed to u=mid-1 in the else part of else in while loop. Then this will be correct.<br>Since we need to decrease the upper bound to mid -1 when n is  &lt; than mid.\\ncode crashes if you search for a number not present and mid is bigger than the search number!!!\\nSay in hindi\\nPlay in 0.75 speed - you&#39;re welcome 😁\\nExcellent tutorial for learning, Thanks sir.    some minor corrections  are u= len(list)    there is no need -1 and  u = mid  there is no need +1...

I tried using a friend&#39;s computer but it didnt work\\nwhen we can using the differnt networks for client and server it not working i showing that timeout prob how can solve that .<br>i  want to send the images through internet with programs in an different network it means from anywhere ,tell me ur suggestion for this?\\nI liked your tutorial, however one phrasing of yours gave me headache: You described the return value of s.accept() as the client socket. This is weird and indeed wrong. I was thinking: How can the client c send stuff to the client, and why is it called in the server script? Puzzling. So I found in the documentation: socket.accept()\\r<br>\\r<br>Accept a connection. The socket must be bound to an address and listening for connections. The return value is a pair (conn, address) where conn is a new socket object usable to send and receive data on the connection, and address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection.<br><br>So it is actually something like an &#39;extra socket object&quot; specifically for communication (send/receive) in that exact communication between server and client. Maybe you want to pin this or rewrite it in your video description, because it might help others who get confused as well.\\nYou are the man!\\nYou are amazing sir.\\nGod bless this man\\nhello,<br>I m getting this error, <br>    print(c.recv(3124).decode())\\r<br>ConnectionAbortedError: [WinError 10053] An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine<br>Please help me..\\nExcellent Tutorial but I have a problem.

Que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) sinta a minha falta e venha ao meu encontro e me peça que nunca o abandone. Que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) (FALE O SEU NOME) e o (NOME DELE JUNTO) assim seja e assim será.

Que esteja com saudades. Que (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) tenha a minha imagem em seu pensamento em todos os momentos do seu dia. Agora com quem estiver, onde estiver (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) você estará em mim ao deitar, ao acordar que tenha sonhos comigo fazendo assim com que me ame a cada dia mais. Se estiver dormindo que acorde com saudades de mim que sinta prazer. Somente em ouvir a minha voz (FALA O NOME DO AMADO) sentirá um desejo fora do normal como nunca sentiu por ninguém e que nunca sentirás. Salve sete saias.

one-hundred.<br>The video showcases the beauty of datatype interplay in python and why using the right kind of datatype is important. The conversion of one datatype into another is known as type casting and it has two types:<br>i) Implicit type casting<br>In this type of type casting, the type of the variable is changed implicitly (automatically without specifying) by the interpreter. Datatypes in python follow a hierarchy and the &quot;lower&quot; datatype is converted to a &quot;higher&quot; datatype if and when need be. The hierarchy of datatypes is chosen such that there is no loss of data.<br>ii) Explicit type casting<br>In this type of type casting, the variable datatype is changed explicitly (upon specification) by the programmer. This is done for various reasons such as data manipulation to achieve a certain objective or to perform operations on datatypes of two different hierarchies. Explicit type casting allows one to cast from a higher datatype to a lower one, something which implicit typecasting does not allow.\\n22\\nDay 5 of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode\">#100DaysOfCode</a>.<br>Attendance: November 8, 2023\\nHi sir. good to see you. sir, when i clicking the day replit link then i get only console page. i tried multiple time. i didn&#39;t day-9 all tutorial pages and exercise..\\nsir how to see your code in the repal?\\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=00m02s\">00:02</a> Type Casting is an important concept in programming<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=01m07s\">01:07</a> The commenter had a problem with getting 12 as the result.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=02m14s\">02:14</a> Concatenating strings in Python<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=03m13s\">03:13</a> Python supports type casting or type conversion<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=04m25s\">04:25</a> Type casting in Python<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=05m38s\">05:38</a> Understanding Explicit and Implicit Type Casting<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=06m41s\">06:41</a> Type Conversion in Python<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=07m58s\">07:58</a> Implicit type casting in Python\\nI&#39;m Present\\nbruh not me watching at 1.5x speed and rewinding back to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu5bqySSSS0&amp;t=6m35s\">6:35</a> and laughing at how fast he reads\\nNot 1x there are some legend going with the speed of 1.25x 🤭❤\\nlove from pakistan\\nprecent\\nPRESENT SIR\\npresent\\nprint(&quot;thanks&quot;)<br>print(&quot;harry&quot;\\nPresent sir ❤\\nstring = &quot;15&quot;\\r<br>number = 7\\r<br>\\r<br># Convert the string to an integer\\r<br>string_number = int(string)  # You mistakenly used &#39;astring&#39; instead of &#39;string&#39;\\r<br>\\r<br># Now you can add the two numbers\\r<br>sum = number + string_number\\r<br>\\r<br># Print the result\\r<br>print(&quot;The sum of both the numbers is&quot;, sum)\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23codewithharryop\">#CodewithharryOP</a><br>Python ❤ OP\\npresent day 9\\npresent\\nboss ye type casting professional main kahin use hoti hai?\\nday 2 video 9 typecasting in python                                                                                                                                                                                            <br>video 10 user input in python\\nYou looks like a Bollywood character Named (Govinda)\\nIntro 😆\\nSuper bro\\nLove you sir yrr\\nday 9\\nHi, where do I get your python notes which you make on the the right hand side on your replet I tried to find if in rellet but couldn&#39;t plz help\\npresent 09 day\\nIn this tutorial when I was watching this tutorial.

This video marks ten percent of the workshop as we slowly but surely march towards completion.<br>To make a program intuitive to use, it must be able to interact with a user, that is why today we learnt how to take inputs from a user in python. All good programs cater to the needs of the hour rather than executing the same code again and again. Taking inputs from a user is the most basic method of integrating the usage environment in a program. <br>The input() function in python helps us achieve this. This function pauses the execution of the program when called and returns a string value entered by the user in the terminal. A string can be given as an argument to accompany the function call and the user gets prompted to give an input. This can be useful to let the user know that the program is waiting for them or what kind of input we are expecting.<br>The function returns a string but this string may* be type cast into the datatype of our choice using the corresponding functions necessary for typecasting such as int() float() tuple() etc.<br>As such we can make our program interactive.\\ngood bhai\\nThnks bhai you are amazing\\nDay 6 of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode\">#100DaysOfCode</a>.\\r<br>Attendance: November 9, 2023<br><br>a = input(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;)<br>print(&quot;My name is&quot;, a)<br>b = input(&quot;Please enter your age: &quot;)<br>print(&quot;My age is&quot;, a)<br>c = input(&quot;Your Girlfriend&#39;s Name: &quot;)<br>print(&quot;The name of my girlfriend is: c&quot;)<br>d = input(&quot;Please enter your Favorite movie: &quot;)<br>print(&quot;My favorite movie is&quot;, d)<br>e = input(&quot;Please enter your best friend&#39;s name: &quot;)<br>print(&quot;My best friends name is&quot;,e)<br><br>a = input(&quot;Enter your first Number: &quot;)<br>b = input(&quot;Enter your second Number: &quot;)<br>a = int(a)<br>b = int(b)<br>print(&quot;the sum of a and b is: &quot; , a+b)<br>print(&quot;The difference of a and be is: &quot; , a-b)<br>print(&quot;The Multiplication of a and b: &quot; , a*b)<br>print(&quot;The devision of a and b is: &quot;, a/b)<br>print(&quot;The reminder of a and b is: &quot; , a%b)<br>print(&quot;The floor division of a and b is: &quot; , a//b)<br>print(&quot;The exponential of a and b is: &quot; , a**b)\\nHarry bhai here&#39;s the code of a simple calculator i made myself😄<br>x = input(&quot;Input first Number: &quot;)<br>y = input(&quot;Input second Number: &quot;)<br>print(&quot;This is the addition: &quot;, int(x) + int(y))<br>print(&quot;This is the subtraction: &quot;, int(x) - int(y))<br>print(&quot;This is the multiplication: &quot;, int(x) * int(y))<br>print(&quot;This is the division: &quot;, int(x) / int(y))\\npresent\\nI am in class 7th\\nI&#39;m present!\\nHarry bruhh ❤\\nThank you sir❤❤\\na=input(&#39;&#39;enter Harry bhai age&quot;)<br>b=input(&quot;enter Harry bhai parents age&quot;)<br>Print(int(a)+int(b))<br><br>a =100+<br>b=100+<br><br><br>❤❤❤may you and your family always blessed ❣️\\na = input(&quot;Enter First Number  : &quot;)<br>b = input(&quot;Enter Second Number : &quot;)<br><br>print(&quot;The value of&quot;, int(a) + int(b))<br>print(&quot;The value of&quot;, int(a) - int(b))<br>print(&quot;The value of&quot;, int(a) * int(b))<br>print(&quot;The value of&quot;, int(a) ** int(b))<br>print(&quot;The value of&quot;, int(a) / int(b))<br>print(&quot;The value of&quot;, int(a) // int(b))\\nKya mobile pe python seekh skty?????\\na=input(first number)<br>b=input(second number)<br><br>Print(&#39;&#39;sum of number is&quot;,int(a)+ int(b))\\nHai mai dehek Raha ho mai 4 class ka bacha\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23take\">#Take</a> a Number from user\\r<br>n = input(&quot;type your name:&quot;)\\r<br>x = input(&quot;type ypur first number&quot;)\\r<br>y = input(&quot;type your second number&quot;)\\r<br>\\r<br>\\r<br>print(&quot;hello &quot;, n)\\r<br>print(&quot;x + y:&quot;, int(x)+int(y))\\r<br>print(&quot;x - y:&quot;, int(x)-int(y))\\r<br>print(&quot;x / y:&quot;, int(x)/int(y))\\r<br>print(&quot;x * y:&quot;, int(x)*int(y))\\nBhaiya aap India me kaha se hoo\\nEk question ha harry bhiya <br>A=“1”<br>B=“2”<br>Print(float(A)+(B))<br><br><br>Tell me answer plz <br><br><br>Because mere US’s me &gt;&gt;2 aara h…why???\\nPresent baba\\npresent\\nPresent sir 😂\\nharry bhai i am gaurav ek doubt tha <br>a = input(&quot;Enter the first number&quot;)<br>b= input(&quot;Enter the second number&quot;)<br>sum = int(a) + float(b)<br>print(sum)<br>uper wale program m error aa raha h float side m\\nx = input (&quot;Enter First Number = &quot; )\\r<br>y = input (&quot;Enter Second Number = &quot;)\\r<br>\\r<br>print (f&quot;Subtraction Result = &quot;,int(x)-int(y),&quot;\\\\nMultiplication Result = &quot;,int(x)*int(y), &quot;\\\\nDivision Result = &quot;,int(x)/int(y), &quot;\\\\nFloor Division Floor = &quot;,int(x)//int(y), &quot;\\\\nModulas Result = &quot;,int(x)%int(y), &quot;\\\\nExpen Result = &quot;,int(x)**int(y))\\n#1.

(function only)<br>Strings are &quot;like&quot; but not exactly arrays of characters. Each individual character of a string can be accessed in the same way as an element of an array can.<br>Strings may be enclosed in a pair of double quotes, a pair of single quotes, three pairs of single quotes or three pairs of double quotes.<br>A string enclosed in a pair of single quotes can freely use double quotes inside of it without the need of using escape sequences and vice-versa for a string enclosed in double quotes. A string enclosed in three pairs of single or double quotes can freely use single and double quotes inside without the need of escaping them, as long as they are not three consecutive quotes of the same kind as we started the string with.<br>Enclosing a string within three pairs of quotes has the advantage than we no longer have to use the escape sequence for the newline character and can simply jump to the next line in the compiler internally within the string without getting an error.<br>A string can be input directly till it receives a command from the terminal using the input() function.<br><br>An interesting observation was that the multiline comment in python is also made within three pairs of quotes, the only difference is that this is not assigned to any variable. This naturally raises the question, does python treat multi-line comments as stray strings? That is, does python allocate memory for multi line comments, and simply skips over them so as to not interrupt the code?<br><br>edit: Yes indeed is the answer to the above question, all of the questions in fact! Multi line comments are also called &quot;docstrings&quot; or &quot;documentation strings.&quot;<br>The python interpreter treats multiline comments as normal strings and allocated memory to them, but since the strings are not assigned to any variable, the functioning of the code is left superficially unaffected, but deep inside the kernel the program requires more memory and more time to execute since it has to create a new (probably large) string object\\nDay 7 of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode\">#100DaysOfCode</a>.\\r<br>Attendance: November 10, 2023<br><br>name = (&quot;Ramdam&quot;)<br>print(name)<br>print(&quot;Hello&quot;, name)<br>country = &quot;Nepal&quot;<br><br>apple = &quot;He said, \\\\&quot;I want to eat an apple\\\\&quot;&quot;<br>print(apple)<br>apple = &#39;He said, &quot;I want to eat an apple&quot;&#39;<br>print(apple)<br>apple = &quot;He said, &#39;I want to eat an apple&#39;&quot;<br>print(apple)<br>introduction = &quot;&quot;&quot;My name is Dil Ramdam.<br>I am from Nepal. <br>I am currently living in vitry sur seine<br>I am looking for job.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>print(introduction)<br>print(name[0])<br>print(name[1])<br>print(name[2])<br>print(name[3])<br>print(name[4])<br>print(name[5])<br>print(&quot;lets learn for loop&quot;)<br>for character in country:<br>  print(character)<br>for character in introduction:<br>  print(character)\\nBrother hand written notes mil sakte h kya plz......\\n10: 50 par 18th line main down arrow kahan se aaya and what it meant???????\\nTriple quote se to comment hoto h\\nday 2\\nJava automatically detect it is int or float that&#39;s why I&#39;m getting problem thanks for solving doubt\\nI&#39;m present!\\nsir ye loop meray pass kaam ni krta. pta ni kyun\\nhow many people watching  this video<br>till now\\nName = &quot;Shais&quot;\\r<br>Statement = &quot;I am learning python programming language becuase i want to become a Machine learning Engineer&quot;\\r<br>Paragraph = &quot;&quot;&quot;The future of world\\r<br>is totaly dependent on\\r<br>Machine learning \\r<br>in near future\\r<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;\\r<br>print (Name)\\r<br>print (Statement)\\r<br>print (Paragraph)\\r<br>\\r<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23check\">#Check</a> Characters in String Name &amp; String Statement \\r<br>for character in Name :\\r<br>    print (character)\\r<br>for character in Statement :\\r<br>    print (character)\\r<br>    \\r<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23print\">#Print</a> Specific character form string Name using index\\r<br>\\r<br>print (&quot;Character for string \\\\&#39;Name\\\\&#39; at 3rd index = &quot; ,Name[4])\\nDay 11\\n<a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a>\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23python\">#Python</a> OP  Harry Bhai OP\\na=input(&quot;Enter First Number: &quot;)\\r<br>b=input(&quot;Enter Second Number: &quot;)\\r<br>print(int(a)+int(b))\\r<br>print(int(a)-int(b))\\r<br>print(int(a)*int(b))\\r<br>print(int(a)%int(b))\\na=15\\r<br>b=9\\r<br>a=input(&quot;Enter First Number: &quot;)\\r<br>b=input(&quot;Enter Second Number: &quot;)\\r<br>print(int(a)+int(b))\\r<br>print(int(a)-int(b))\\r<br>print(int(a)*int(b))\\r<br>print(int(a)%int(b))\\npresent\\nDay 11 done\\nday 11\\nDay10 done\\nAap aapke channel ka naam Coding Ka Baap set karlo acha rehta..

Your way of explaining is way easier and understandable than others. Your efforts and content are worth mentioning. You tell everything bit by bit in easy words. Thanks for teaching and giving us your time. You deserve a compliment. 😄\\nAnswer : ar\\noutput is     ar\\nnm=&quot;Harry&quot;<br>print(nm[-4:-2])<br>*The length of the string is 5, and the order of characters starts from zero, so H(0), a(1), r(2), r(3), y(4). <br>Back to the code;<br>(len(nm)-4--&gt;5-4=1<br>(len(nm)-4--&gt;5-2=3<br>*Hypothetically new statement is print(nm[1:3])<br>we know starting point is 1, but to access charater&#39;s order we use n-1 principal.<br> So, order of character=n-1<br>OC=3-1=2<br>Take order of character from 1 to 2 from the actual string; hence, out put is (ar).\\nDay 12 of 100<br>Here we learn how to slice strings into substrings. The technique will be particularly useful when we are working with large strings and string slicing forms the basis of string manipulation.<br>To get the length (int) of a string we use the len(stringobject) function. This returns the exact number of characters inside a particular string. (Question: Does it include null characters as well?)<br>To get a substring from a string by slicing we use the format stringobj[a:b] where a is the lower limit and b the upper. The substring includes the character at the &#39;a&#39;th index till the character at the &#39;b-1&#39;th index.<br>(Question: Is strobject[a:a+1] equivalent to strobject[a] since the former returns a string and the latter a char)<br>If a&gt;=b then the returned string is null<br>If a&lt;0 then we replace a by a+len(strobject) and b&lt;0 then we do the same. This is called negative slicing.<br>We also brushed over looping over a string using a character variable using the syntax<br>for ch in range stringobject:<br> statements<br>end<br><br>Answer to question 1<br>Yes, null characters form parts of the string itself hence all null characters are treated at par with regular characters<br><br>Answer to question 2<br>In both cases the return type is string even for strobject[a] hence it was said string is &quot;like&quot; an array of characters, not an array of characters.\\nDay 8 of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode\">#100DaysOfCode</a>.\\r<br>Attendance: November 11, 2023<br><br># Quick Quiz:\\r<br>nm = &quot;Harry&quot;\\r<br>print(nm[-4:-2])<br><br>Output = ar<br><br>names = &quot;Sakshi, Dil&quot;<br>print(names[0:6])<br>print(names[1:5])<br>print(names[-1:-3])<br>print(names[ : 4])<br>len1 = len(names)<br>print(len1)<br>print(&quot;The length of len1 is&quot;, len1, &quot;letter word&quot;)<br>School = &quot;Imperial&quot;<br>len2 = len((School))<br>print(len2)\\nar\\n# The Output of the program is: \\r<br>ar<br><br>nm = &quot;Harry&quot;\\r<br>print(nm[-4:-2])<br><br>start = len(nm) - 4<br>start = 5 - 4 = 1<br><br>end = len(nm) - 2<br>end = 5 -2 = 3<br><br><br>nm[1:3] #1 is including and 3 is excluding<br><br>H a r r y<br>0 1 2 3 4\\nanswer is ar because length of &quot;Harry&quot;

As Harry told us that the code will give US time if we run it in replit, so we have to run code in VS code. But it didn&#39;t work for me. I couldn&#39;t find pdf from replit&#39;s id link. So, this is the code to get your local time in replit. <br>import pytz<br>from datetime import datetime<br><br># Set your local time zone<br>local_tz = pytz.timezone(&quot;Asia/Karachi&quot;)<br><br># Get the current time in your local time zone<br>current_time = datetime.now(local_tz)<br><br># Format the current time as &quot;hour:minutes:seconds&quot;<br>formatted_time = current_time.strftime(&quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;)<br><br># Print the formatted local time<br>print(&quot;Your local time is:&quot;, formatted_time)<br><br># Check the hour of the current time and print the appropriate greeting<br>hour = current_time.hour<br><br>if 5 &lt;= hour &lt; 12:<br>    print(&quot;Good morning!&quot;)<br>elif 12 &lt;= hour &lt; 17:<br>    print(&quot;Good afternoon!&quot;)<br>else:<br>    print(&quot;Good evening!&quot;)<br><br>In the first line, we import the `pytz` library, which helps us work with different time zones. Then, we import the `datetime` module, which allows us to work with dates and times.\\r<br>\\r<br>Next, we set the `local_tz` variable to your local time zone, which is &quot;Asia/Karachi&quot; for Kunjah, Punjab Province, Pakistan (you can write your location). This line tells the code which time zone to consider when getting the current time.\\r<br>\\r<br>Then, we use `datetime.now(local_tz)` to get the current time in your local time zone. This line captures the current date and time information.\\r<br>\\r<br>After that, we format the current time as &quot;hour:minutes:seconds&quot; using `strftime(&quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;)`. This line takes the current time and converts it into a formatted string.\\r<br>\\r<br>Finally, we print the formatted local time using `print(&quot;Your local time is:&quot;, formatted_time)`.\\r<br>\\r<br>To write a program that returns &quot;Good morning,&quot; &quot;Good afternoon,&quot; or &quot;Good evening&quot; according to the time, you can use an `if` statement to check the hour of the current time and then print the appropriate greeting. Here&#39;s an example:\\r<br>\\r<br>```python\\r<br>hour = current_time.hour\\r<br>\\r<br>if 5 &lt;= hour &lt; 12:\\r<br>    print(&quot;Good morning!&quot;)\\r<br>elif 12 &lt;= hour &lt; 17:\\r<br>    print(&quot;Good afternoon!&quot;)\\r<br>else:\\r<br>    print(&quot;Good evening!&quot;)\\r<br>```\\r<br>\\r<br>In this code, we use the `hour` attribute of the `current_time` variable to get the hour component of the current time. Then, we use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to check the value of `hour` and print the corresponding greeting.\\nimport time\\r<br>spacetime = time.strftime(&#39;%H,%M,%S&#39;)\\r<br>print(spacetime)\\r<br>spacetime = int(time.strftime(&#39;%H&#39;))\\r<br>print(spacetime)\\r<br>if(spacetime &gt;= 17):\\r<br>    if(spacetime&lt;=23):\\r<br>        print(&quot;Good Night&quot;)\\r<br>elif(spacetime &gt;23):\\r<br>    if(spacetime &lt;12):\\r<br>        print(&quot;Good morning&quot;)\\r<br>elif(spacetime &gt; 12):\\r<br>    print(&quot;Good evening&quot;)\\n<a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a>Here is my Code : <br>&#39;&#39;&#39;Day 15&#39;&#39;&#39;<br>timestamp=time.strftime(&#39;%H:%M:%S&#39;)<br>if(timestamp&gt;=&quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ng_aV4qdI&amp;t=05h00m00s\">05:00:00</a>&quot;):<br>  print(&quot;Good Morning&quot;)<br>elif(timestamp&gt;=&quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ng_aV4qdI&amp;t=12h00m00s\">12:00:00</a>&quot;):<br>  print(&quot;Good Afternoon&quot;)<br>elif(timestamp&gt;=&quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ng_aV4qdI&amp;t=18h00m00s\">18:00:00</a>&quot; and timestamp&lt;=&quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ng_aV4qdI&amp;t=22h00m00s\">22:00:00</a>&quot;):<br>  print(&quot;Good Evening&quot;)<br>else:<br>  print(&quot;Good night&quot;)\\nEveryone is using the strd time module can we do it like this it is working for me currently.

Means that, if beginners comes here and learn the python from your playlist then he or she might loose the opportunity to build the basic logics in programming. You are just dumping your code and explaining the code directly with little examples and saying practice make man prefect. . Conclusion is that please explain small small things properly so that beginners should not go to others videos after watching your playlist.

Today in this video 23, I learned about various list methods in Python, including sort(), reverse(), index(), count(), copy(), append(), insert(), and extend(). These methods help in sorting lists, reversing their order, finding the index or count of an item, creating a copy of the list, appending items, inserting items at specific indexes, and extending a list with another collection datatype. Additionally, I learned that we can concatenate two lists to join them together. These methods make list manipulation in Python more efficient and convenient.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.\\nwhat is difference between extend and concatenating of list methods.\\n✌\\nMe continuing it again after 8 days because of exams .....in the end he says this😅😅😅\\nCarry why don&#39;t you start a discord Channel where all your viewers can discuss any problem should they have any\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23day23\">#day23</a> completed\\nday 23 present sir\\nPresent Sir, Done.

Today in this video 24, I learned about Python tuples, which are ordered, unchangeable collections of data items. Tuples use round brackets () and support positive and negative indexing, as well as checking for items using the &#39;in&#39; keyword. I can also access items within a specific range or print alternate values using start, end, and jump index parameters. Tuples offer an efficient way to store multiple items in a single variable, while maintaining their order and immutability.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.\\n✌\\nMe continuing it again after 8 days because of exams .....in the end he says this😅😅😅\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23day\">#day</a> 24 completed\\nThis is so easy if you watch the video of list\\nHi Harry, Firstly thanks for the tutorial I am currently on #24 and planning to complete the playlist in the next couple of weeks.<br>I have a question here.

Today in this video 25,  I learned that tuples are immutable, so to add, remove, or change their items, I need to first convert them to a list, manipulate the list, and then convert it back to a tuple. I also discovered that tuples can be directly concatenated without conversion. Additionally, I explored two built-in tuple methods: count() to find the number of occurrences of an element, and index() to find the first occurrence of an element. It was interesting to understand the unique features and limitations of tuples.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23day25\">#day25</a> completed\\nThanks for Making This\\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XblLSduioJI&amp;t=2m16s\">2:16</a> check spelling of Sri Lanka\\nPresent Sir, Thanks!!\\nPresent sir\\nPresent sir\\nin the first program of this video why england is not came as output\\nPresent sir <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23day\">#Day</a> 25 COMPLETE!!!!\\nday 25 completed\\nThanks harry bhaiya, aapka bahut bahut dhanyavad to make such videos and make us learn python aka virtual sapola<br>print(&quot;Ready for day 26&quot;)\\nHarry bhai heera hai 💎\\nday 25 absent sir\\n84|\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23harrybhai\">#HarryBhai</a>\\nPresent sir<br>Day 25 of 100 days of code\\nHarryBhai now you start React playlist step to step with notes. 🙏 ple...\\nI am present.\\nPRESENT BRO!\\nSir, I am from Pakistan.

Today in this video 26, I learned how to create a Python program that greets me with &quot;Good Morning,&quot; &quot;Good Afternoon,&quot; or &quot;Good Evening&quot; based on the current hour. I used the time module and its strftime() function to obtain the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

Today in this video 28, I learned about string formatting in Python using the format method and f-strings. The format method allows for more precise control over the formatting, such as specifying the number of decimal places. F-strings, introduced in PEP 498, provide a convenient way to embed Python expressions directly inside string literals for formatting. By prefixing a string with &#39;f&#39;, it becomes an f-string, making it easier to interpolate variables and expressions.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.\\nimport random\\r<br># List Of Questions\\r<br>list = {1:[&quot;Spelling Of Cat: &quot; ,&quot;A : c a t&quot; ,&quot;B : c o t&quot; , &quot;C : d o g&quot;], 2:[&quot;4+4=?&quot; ,&quot;A:7&quot;,&quot;B:0&quot;, &quot;C:8&quot;]}\\r<br># Getting Random Number\\r<br>q = random.randint(1,len(list))\\r<br># List Of Correct Answers\\r<br>licorrects = {1:&quot;A : c a t&quot; , 2:&quot;C:8&quot;}\\r<br>\\r<br>\\r<br># Function For KBC\\r<br>def kbc(q=2 ):\\r<br>\\r<br>    # Printing Question in terminal\\r<br>    print(&quot;Question  : &quot; , list[q][0], &quot;\\\\n&quot;, list[q][1], &quot;\\\\n&quot;, list[q][2], &quot;\\\\n&quot;, list[q][3])\\r<br>    # Getting Answer (input)\\r<br>    ans = input(&quot;Please Choose an Option: &quot;)\\r<br>\\r<br>    # Infinite While Loop for checking answers \\r<br>    while True:\\r<br>        # Condition For Answer (A)\\r<br>        if ans==&quot;A&quot; or ans==&quot;a&quot;:\\r<br>            # If The answer is Correct Then Do What\\r<br>            if list[q][1]==licorrects[q]:\\r<br>                print(&quot;7 Crore.&quot;)\\r<br>            # If The Answer is Wrong Then Do What\\r<br>            else:\\r<br>                print(&quot;Wrong Answer. &quot;)\\r<br>            break\\r<br>\\r<br>        # Condition For Answer (b)\\r<br>        elif ans==&quot;B&quot; or ans==&quot;b&quot;:\\r<br>            # If The answer is Correct Then Do What\\r<br>            if list[q][2]==licorrects[q]:\\r<br>                print(&quot;7 Crore.&quot;)\\r<br>            # If The Answer is Wrong Then Do What\\r<br>            else:\\r<br>                print(&quot;Wrong Answer. &quot;)\\r<br>            break\\r<br>\\r<br>        # Condition For Answer (c)\\r<br>        elif ans==&quot;C&quot; or ans==&quot;c&quot;:\\r<br>            # If The answer is Correct Then Do What\\r<br>            if list[q][3]==licorrects[q]:\\r<br>                print(&quot;7 Crore.&quot;)\\r<br>            # If The Answer is Wrong Then Do What\\r<br>            else:\\r<br>                print(&quot;Wrong Answer. &quot;)\\r<br>            break\\r<br>\\r<br>\\r<br>        # Condition For wrong input for Answer\\r<br>        else:\\r<br>            ans = input( &quot;\\\\n&quot;+ &quot;Your Question is : &quot; + list[q][0] +&quot;\\\\n&quot; + list[q][1] + &quot;\\\\n&quot; + list[q][2] + &quot;\\\\n&quot; + list[q][3] + &quot;\\\\n&quot; + &quot;Please Choose Correct: &quot; )\\r<br>    \\r<br>\\r<br># Running the Function\\r<br>kbc(q)\\nPresent !

Today in this video 29, I delved into Python docstrings, which are string literals that follow the definition of a function, method, class, or module. They serve as documentation for our code and can be accessed using the &#39;__doc__&#39; attribute. I also explored the differences between Python comments and docstrings. Furthermore, I learned about PEP 8, a guide for Python coding style, and The Zen of Python, which outlines the guiding principles for Python&#39;s design.<br>Thank You Harry Bhaiya.\\ncode is here :-<br>\\r<br>\\r<br>\\r<br>def wish(name):\\r<br>    print(&quot;Hello to the game Mr {}&quot;.format(name))\\r<br>\\r<br>a = input(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;)\\r<br>wish(a)\\r<br>\\r<br>def Quiz(question, answer, prize1, prize2, prize3):\\r<br>    c1 = input(question[0])\\r<br>    if c1.lower() == answer[0].lower():\\r<br>        print(&quot;Correct answer and you won {} $&quot;.format(prize1))\\r<br>    else:\\r<br>        print(&quot;Wrong answer&quot;)\\r<br>\\r<br>    c2 = input(question[1])\\r<br>    if c2.lower() == answer[1].lower():\\r<br>        print(&quot;Correct answer and you won {} $&quot;.format(prize2))\\r<br>    else:\\r<br>        print(&quot;Wrong answer&quot;)\\r<br>\\r<br>    c3 = input(question[2])\\r<br>    if c3.lower() == answer[2].lower():\\r<br>        print(&quot;Correct answer and you won {} $&quot;.format(prize3))\\r<br>    else:\\r<br>        print(&quot;Wrong answer&quot;)\\r<br>\\r<br>question = [&quot;What is the capital of India? &quot;, &quot;What color is an apple? &quot;, &quot;Which team won IPL in 2022? &quot;]\\r<br>answer = [&quot;Delhi&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Gujarat Titans&quot;]\\r<br>prize1 = 1000\\r<br>prize2 = 2000\\r<br>prize3 = 3000\\r<br>\\r<br>Quiz(question, answer, prize1, prize2, prize3)\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23day29\">#day29</a> completed\\nHe is my fist teacher of language<br><br>Like if same\\nPEP - 8 ka really matalb kya hai\\nPresent Sir,Thanks!!\\n29th lecture done\\nAAP HI HUMARE PEP 8 HO HARRY BHAI, LOVE YOU\\nday 29 completed\\ntime wasted for this video just watch till pip8\\nhey hope everyone is doing good.

Sets are collection of well defined data type.<br>2. Set in python is made by { }<br>3. all functions of list are applicable to sets<br>4. sets and lists are different in only that a set does not allow repetition of same entry while in list you can repeat the same item.<br>5. Empty set is made by Emptyset= ( ) instead of { }<br>6. There is no guaranttee of order being maintained by Python within a set so output can change every time. (bummer)<br>7.

For example, if you forget to close a parentheses or forget to indent code properly, you will get a syntax error.\\r<br>\\r<br>Name errors: These occur when you try to use a variable that has not been defined.\\r<br>\\r<br>Type errors: These occur when you try to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For example, if you try to add a string and a number, you will get a type error.\\r<br>\\r<br>Index errors: These occur when you try to access an element in a list or a string using an index that is out of bounds.\\r<br>\\r<br>Value errors: These occur when a built-in function receives an argument of the right type, but an inappropriate value.\\r<br>\\r<br>Attribute errors: These occur when you try to access an attribute of an object that does not exist.<br><br>Import errors: These occur when you try to import a module that does not exist or cannot be found.\\r<br>\\r<br>Key errors: These occur when you try to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist.\\r<br>\\r<br>File not found errors: These occur when you try to open a file that does not exist or cannot be found.\\r<br>\\r<br>Indentation errors: These occur when the indentation of the code is not consistent, which can cause the interpreter to behave unexpectedly.\\r<br>\\r<br>Zero division errors: These occur when you try to divide a number by zero, which is not allowed in Python.\\r<br>\\r<br>Recursion errors: These occur when a function calls itself recursively, but the base case is not defined, causing the function to call itself indefinitely.\\r<br>\\r<br>Memory errors: These occur when the program tries to use more memory than the computer has available.\\r<br>\\r<br>Overflow errors: These occur when a calculation produces a result that is too large to be stored in the allocated memory.\\r<br>\\r<br>Underflow errors: These occur when a calculation produces a result that is too small to be represented accurately in the allocated memory.<br><br>Assertion errors: These occur when an assert statement fails.\\r<br>\\r<br>Not implemented errors: These occur when a method or function has not been implemented yet.\\r<br>\\r<br>Runtime errors: These occur while the program is running and can be caused by a variety of factors, such as invalid input, missing resources, or other unforeseen circumstances.\\r<br>\\r<br>Security errors: These occur when the program tries to perform an action that is not allowed due to security restrictions.\\r<br>\\r<br>Timeout errors: These occur when a program takes too long to run and exceeds the allotted time limit.\\r<br>\\r<br>Unbound local errors: These occur when you try to access a local variable before it has been defined.\\r<br>\\r<br>Internal errors: These occur when the interpreter encounters an unexpected condition that it cannot handle.\\r<br>\\r<br>External errors: These occur when the program interacts with an external resource (such as a database or a network connection) and something goes wrong.\\r<br>\\r<br>It is also worth noting that Python allows you to define your own custom errors using the Exception class. This can be useful if you want to create specific error handling logic for your program.\\nPresent\\nSir I&#39;m from com background, but I&#39;ve opted for cs in college. Is it okay for my syllabus?

I am Solution Architect with over 11 Y of Experience. Still i feel, this course is kick start of python coding and worth accepting 100 Days Challenge. 99.99% people will feel complete post attending this course. Good Work Harry!. I feel, you are carrying mission the way &quot;KHAN SIR GS PATNA &quot; is doing.. Lucky to find your course on YouTube, which made me motivated to peruse my interest toward python. &quot;EDUCATION IS FOR ALL, AN EDUCATED PERSON CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THIS...Way to go..&quot;\\nTook help from google and then discovered the random module.

Import string. Is module ke andar ek ascii_letters naam ka object hota hai, which is a string of all the alphabets in lowercase and uppercase. We have 26 alphabets in total. Lowercase and Uppercase mila ke 26*2=52 hote hai. To 0-51 me se koi bhi 3 numbers generate karke slicing karke us index ka character utha lenge.<br><br>Example,<br>import random, string\\r<br>x=&quot;String&quot;\\r<br>for i in range(3):\\r<br>    x = string.ascii_letters[random.randint(0, 51)] + x\\r<br>for i in range(3):\\r<br>    x = x + string.ascii_letters[random.randint(0, 51)]<br><br><br>2. Using chr() function : chr() function given number ke corresponding ASCII value return kar deta hai. To ham 0-25 ek random number generate karwa lenge, then usme 65 add kar lenge.

But even if we use inheritance to create a new class containing the prev class, it still raises an error if we use any functions of the new class using prev class name. So, in the eg in this vid, we have to again change wherever employee was mentioned to programmer to access new programmer methods.<br>But we could just change the name of employee to programmer in the class def, as well as when we call the class methods and that would be alright<br>Please clarify how we benefit from inheritance, if we already have a class created and want to add new functions in it, but can&#39;t do that by just adding those methods in the class again, instead of using inheritance\\nim present sir\\nHarry bhai last me pita ka bahut achha udhaharan diya😂\\nreally explanative video.\\nI Think we need to use super().  to  use the methods of the parent class from the subclass. right?\\ni love you\\nComputer screen is not clear.......Kindly.......Ck\\nBro how do you code in an ipad?\\nDay 61 completed\\nLove the way you teach bro… Enters mind like a bullet\\nUnderstanding Every Single Topic Through Your Videos HaryyBhai (SIR) Thankyou So Much\\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KsfUaQEY9Y&amp;t=2m30s\">2:30</a> vintage harry bhai 😂\\nThank you soo much Haris bhai ❤\\nI had my python test today.

It would be great if you could provide some guidance. 🙏 Currently, I&#39;m also seeking help from ChatGPT, but it&#39;s not always possible to easily understand what a function or method is intended for just through code suggestions.\\r<br>\\r<br>For example:\\r<br>\\r<br>PdfWriter Class: 📝\\r<br>This class is used to write PDF files, typically with pages produced by another class, such as PdfReader.\\r<br>\\r<br>append Method: ➕\\r<br>This method is similar to the merge() method but is used to concatenate all pages at the end of the file.\\r<br>\\r<br>fileobj: 📄 This can be a File Object or an object with read and seek methods, similar to a File Object. It could also be a string representing a path to a PDF file.\\r<br>\\r<br>outline_item: 📑 Optionally, you can provide a string to create an outline (bookmark) that identifies the start of the included file.\\r<br>\\r<br>pages: 📃 This can be a PageRange, a tuple (start, stop[, step]), or a list of pages. It&#39;s used to merge a specific range of pages from the source document into the output document.\\r<br>\\r<br>import_outline: ↪ If set to False, you can prevent importing the source document&#39;s outline (bookmarks).\\r<br>\\r<br>excluded_fields: 🚫 You can provide a list of fields/keys to be ignored.

However, if you want to access the superclass&#39;s method from the subclass, you can explicitly call it using the superclass name, as shown in Animal.show_details(self) and Dog.show_details(self) calls.\\nHarry bhai apse axha koi coding teacher ni ho skta.

I was wondering if you could create a full-stack course that would allow us to learn everything altogether. I understand that this is a daunting task, but I believe that with your knowledge and expertise, you could make it happen. Please know that your contributions to the programming world are highly valued and deeply appreciated. You have already shared so much knowledge with us, and for that, we are endlessly grateful.

I wanted to reach out and express my appreciation for your fantastic &quot;100 Days of Code in Python&quot; series on Replit. It has been an invaluable resource for someone like me who is eager to learn and improve their Python programming skills. Your teaching style is clear and engaging, and I have learned a lot from your tutorials.<br><br>While I have been able to follow along and understand most of the concepts you&#39;ve covered, I have encountered a particular issue when attempting to replicate some of your examples in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Specifically, I am having trouble with the file management aspects, especially when you use the &quot;shutil&quot; module to create and manipulate multiple files.<br><br>In Replit, it seems quite straightforward, but when I attempt to do the same in VS Code, I encounter challenges that I&#39;m struggling to overcome. I believe there might be some differences in how file operations work or how the file structure is managed in VS Code compared to Replit.<br><br>I was wondering if you could provide some guidance or advice on how to handle file operations, particularly with the &quot;shutil&quot; module, within the VS Code environment. Any tips, best practices, or resources you could recommend would be greatly appreciated. I want to ensure that I can effectively apply the concepts you&#39;ve taught in my own projects using VS Code.<br><br>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you. Your assistance would be immensely valuable in helping me overcome this hurdle and continue my Python learning journey.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Muhammad Ali <br>Chakwal, Pakistan\\nmera sach me numm ho gyi....Ankha :D\\nAttributeError: partially initialized module &#39;shutil&#39; has no attribute &#39;copytree&#39; (most likely due to a circular import)               getting this error\\nYou are awesome❤ the way you speak padhi aur maza dono ajata hai\\nDay 87 completed\\nkya aab aapka phone sahi hai or aapke pas kitne phone hai aapne kaha tha recoding iphone se ker rahe ho tho ye konsa phone hai btw maine aapki sari video dekhi hai !!! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23codewithharry\">#CodeWithHarry</a>\\nBro ek playlist only  python modules pe create kro plz ...😇\\nidk why i accidentally ran .retree and all my files are gone <a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a>\\nMa\\nSir ,plz increase your font size...\\nIn Windows u should also give directory name like:-<br><br>import shutil\\r<br>\\r<br>\\r<br>shutil.copy(&quot;New folder/<a href=\"http://main.py/\">main.py</a>&quot;, &quot;New folder/<a href=\"http://main2.py/\">main2.py</a>&quot;)\\nharry bhai <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wII2JhNACJE&amp;t=3m56s\">3:56</a> se le kar <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wII2JhNACJE&amp;t=4m08s\">4:08</a> tak kya line boli hai 👌👌👌\\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23day87\">#Day87</a> done!\\nawesome video\\n<a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a><a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a>\\n<a href=\"about:invalid#zCSafez\"></a>\\nYo can delete your file without os module <br><br>If you have a folder &quot;FIles&quot; and a file &quot;File.txt&quot; then 👇👇👇<br>import shutil as st<br>st.move(&#39;File.txt&#39;,&#39;Files&#39;)<br>st.rmtree(&#39;Files&#39;)<br>😂😂😂\\nharis Bhai please make machine learning course\\nDay 87 of 100 of python challenge completed. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100daysofcode\">#100DaysofCode</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100dayspythonchallenge\">#100dayspythonchallenge</a>\\nNice tutorial harry bhai .Now, i am on this video 😍🤩☺🥰 i am very happy\\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/rSfD0Q8SGrk\">https://youtu.be/rSfD0Q8SGrk</a>\\nAmazing experience, especially these stories.

I wanted to reach out and express my appreciation for your fantastic &quot;100 Days of Code in Python&quot; series on Replit. It has been an invaluable resource for someone like me who is eager to learn and improve their Python programming skills. Your teaching style is clear and engaging, and I have learned a lot from your tutorials.<br><br>While I have been able to follow along and understand most of the concepts you&#39;ve covered, I have encountered a particular issue when attempting to replicate some of your examples in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Specifically, I am having trouble with the file management aspects, especially when you use the &quot;shutil&quot; module to create and manipulate multiple files.<br><br>In Replit, it seems quite straightforward, but when I attempt to do the same in VS Code, I encounter challenges that I&#39;m struggling to overcome. I believe there might be some differences in how file operations work or how the file structure is managed in VS Code compared to Replit.<br><br>I was wondering if you could provide some guidance or advice on how to handle file operations, particularly with the &quot;shutil&quot; module, within the VS Code environment. Any tips, best practices, or resources you could recommend would be greatly appreciated. I want to ensure that I can effectively apply the concepts you&#39;ve taught in my own projects using VS Code.<br><br>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

In Python, you can define multiple methods with the same name in a class, but the method that gets executed will be based on the number of arguments passed during the function call. This is known as &quot;overloading by default.&quot; However, you cannot have multiple methods with the same name but different argument types like you would in languages with explicit method overloading.<br><br>class Calculator:<br>    def add(self, a, b):<br>        return a + b<br><br>    def add(self, a, b, c):<br>        return a + b + c<br><br># In this case, only the second add method will be available.<br># The first add method is overridden, and you can only use the one that takes three arguments.<br># This is because Python supports method overloading by default based on the number of arguments.\\nSuperb video sir\\nPython does not allow method overloading\\nSir make video <i>_iter_</i> and <i>_next_</i>  method\\nagar 2 classes ko aik sath call krwana ho 3rd class me to kese karein ge\\nToo good\\nTopic is gud but explanation is brief\\nThank you so much sir\\nThank you so much Sir\\nThanks sir 🥰\\nThank you very much\\nThank you sir ..']\n","['Complete Python Tutorial for Beginners to Advanced in Hindi 🔥', 'PLjVLYmrlmjGcQfNj_SLlLV4Ytf39f8BF7', 'WsCube Tech', 'What are Overloading  and Overriding Methods in Python | Complete Tutorial', 'mYNVbuzA7sk', 716.0, '39758', '754', '\\n😎Hey, thanks for watching!
